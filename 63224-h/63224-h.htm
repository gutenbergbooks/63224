<h3>
PREFACE
</h3>

<p>
No one can be more alive than I am to the fact that
of the making of war books there is no end, nor can
anyone hear mentally more plainly than I do how, at
each fresh appearance of a work dealing with the world
tragedy of the past five years, weary reviewers and
jaded public alike exclaim, "What?  Yet another!"  Why,
then, have I added this of mine to the already
so formidable list?
</p>

<p>
Well, chiefly because in the beginning of 1918 Fate
and the War Office sent me into a field of operations
almost unknown and unheeded of the average
home-keeping Briton&mdash;viz., that of North-West Persia, in
the land lying towards the Caucasus and the Caspian
Sea; and my experiences there led me into bypaths
of the Great War so unusual as to seem well worth
describing, quite apart from the military importance
of the movements of which they were but a minute
part.
</p>

<p>
However, in the latter aspect, too, I hope my book
will serve as a useful footnote to the history of the
gigantic struggle now happily ended.
</p>

<p>
The story of the Persian campaign needed to be
told, and I am glad to add my humble quota to the
recital.  It is the story of a little force operating far
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvi"></a>vi}</span>
away from the limelight, unknown to the people at
home, and seemingly forgotten a great part of the
time even by the authorities themselves.  It was to
this force&mdash;commanded by General Dunsterville,
and hence known to those who knew it at all as
"Dunsterforce"&mdash;that I was attached, and it is
about it that I have written here.  I have tried to
make clear what the "Dunsterforce" was, why it
was sent out, and how far it succeeded in accomplishing
its mission.  In order to do this I have been
obliged to treat rather fully both of local geography
and politics.  For here we had no clear-cut campaign
in which all the people of one country were in arms
against all the people of another country.  No!  It
was a very mixed-up and complicated business, as
anyone who troubles to read what I have written will
readily see.
</p>

<p>
Then, again, it was a war waged distinctly off the
beaten track.  During its progress we came across
tribes to whom Great Britain was as some legendary
land in another solar sphere&mdash;tribes to whom the
aeroplane and the automobile were undreamed-of
marvels&mdash;tribes, finally, whose habitat and modes of life and
thought are almost as unknown to the average
European as his are to them.  For this reason I have
devoted some space to descriptions of places and
people as I saw them.
</p>

<p>
A word should perhaps be said as to how and why
I happened to be there at all.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvii"></a>vii}</span>
</p>

<p>
War has figured very largely in my life.  For the
past twenty years, as Special Correspondent of the
<i>Daily Chronicle</i>, I have been privileged to be present
at most of the world's great upheavals, both military
and political.
</p>

<p>
From July, 1914, on, for some eighteen months, I
followed the fortunes of the Entente armies in the
field as a war chronicler, first in Serbia, next in
Belgium, and afterwards in Italy and Greece&mdash;a poor
journalistic Lazarus picking up such crumbs of news
as fell from the overladen table of Dives, the Censor.
But I was not happy, because I felt I was not doing
my "bit" as effectively as I might; so I followed the
example of millions of other citizens of the Empire
and joined the army.  Detailed to the Intelligence
Corps, I was sent first to Roumania, then to Russia.
Escaping from the "Red Terror" in Petrograd, I
finally found myself one day embarking for the
remote land of Iran as Special Service Officer with
"Dunsterforce"&mdash;at which point this chronicle
begins.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
THE START OF THE "HUSH-HUSH" BRIGADE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
A mystery expedition&mdash;Tower of London conference&mdash;From
Flanders mud to Eastern dust&mdash;An Imperial forlorn hope&mdash;Some
fine fighting types&mdash;The amphibious purser&mdash;In the
submarine zone&mdash;Our Japanese escort.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Scarcely had dawn tinged the sky of a February day
in 1918 when there crept out of the inner harbour
of Taranto a big transport bound for Alexandria.
It was laden with British and Dominion troops.
</p>

<p>
All were for service overseas.  There were units
for India and Egypt, a contingent of Nursing Sisters
for East Africa, and a detachment of Sappers for
Aden.  The transport stealing noiselessly towards
the open sea was the P. and O. liner <i>Malwa</i>, and, as a
precaution against submarine attack, she had been
so extensively and grotesquely camouflaged by
dockyard artists in black and white that some of her own
crew coming alongside on a dark night had difficulty
in recognizing her.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Malwa</i>, too, had on board the members of a
military expedition, surely one of the most
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
extraordinary that ever crossed the sea to fight the battles
of the Empire in distant lands.  Our official
designation was the "Dunsterville" or "Bagdad Party";
but War Office cynics, and the damsel who sold us
our patent filters and Tommy Cookers at the military
equipment stores in London, knew us as the
"Hush-hush" Brigade.  And the "Hush-hush" Brigade
we were privileged to remain.  This nickname met
us in Alexandria, followed us to Cairo and distant
Basra, and preceded us to the City of the Caliphs
on the shores of the muddy-brown Tigris.
</p>

<p>
On the eve of the departure from England of
the main body for the Italian port of embarkation,
a heart-to-heart talk between General Sir William
Robertson and the members of the Bagdad Party
had taken place at the Tower of London.  The veil
of official secrecy was drawn ever so little aside, and,
allowed a peep behind, we beheld a field of military
activity with a distinctly Eastern setting.  Men who
had been "over the top" in Flanders heard with
a joyous throb of expectation that the next time
they went into the line would be probably somewhere
in Persia or the Caucasus.  They were as happy as
children at the prospect, finding it a welcome relief
from muddy tramps through the low-lying lands of
the Western Front, the dull grey skies, the monotony
of life in flooded trenches under incessant
bombardment, varied only by an occasional rush across
No-Man's Land to get at the Hun throat.  We were going
from mud to dust, but hurrah! anyway.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
</p>

<p>
On that February morning, as the <i>Malwa</i> slipped
past Taranto town and into the roadstead where lay
her Japanese destroyer escort, the roll-call of the
Bagdad Party showed a strength of 70 officers and
140 N.C.O's.  This was to be the nucleus of a force
which we hoped would combat and overthrow
Bolshevism, make common cause with Armenians,
Georgians, and Tartars, raise and train local levies,
and bar with a line of bayonets the further progress
of Turk and German by way of the Caspian Sea
and Russian Turkestan towards the Gates of India.
</p>

<p>
With few exceptions our party consisted of
Dominion soldiers gathered from the remote corners
of the Empire.  There were Anzacs and Springboks,
Canadians from the far North-West, men who had
charged up the deadly shell-swept slopes of Gallipoli,
and those who had won through at Vimy Ridge.
They were, in fact, a hardened band of adventurous
soldiers, fit to go anywhere and do anything, men
who had lived on the brink of the pit for three years
and had come back from the Valley of the Shadow
of Death.
</p>

<p>
The War Office needed the raw material for a
desperate enterprise.  It was found by Brigadier-General
Byron, himself an able and experienced
soldier with a brilliant South African fighting
reputation.  He went across to Flanders and picked out
the cream of the fighting men from the South African
contingent and from the magnificent Australian and
Canadian Divisions.  I do not recall a single officer
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
or N.C.O. who had not won at least one decoration
for bravery.  We had with us, too, a small party
of Russian officers who, fleeing from the Red
Terror when their army broke and melted away,
remained loyal to the Entente, and volunteered
for the Caucasus, where they hoped to prove to the
Bolsheviks that the cause of Russian national and
military honour was not entirely lost.
</p>

<p>
Our Russian allies for the Caucasus were mostly
young men, enthusiastic and keen soldiers, endowed
with the splendid fighting spirit of the old Russian
Army such as I knew it in the early spring campaign
of 1915 in Bukovina, when it fought with empty
rifles and stood up to the encircling Austrians in
those terrible February days that preceded and
followed the evacuation of Czernowitch.
</p>

<p>
On the <i>Malwa</i>, I remember, we had with us Captain
Bray, an Anglo-Russian who had been a liaison
officer in London, and spoke English like an
Englishman.  Then there was a Colonel who had been
earmarked for death when his regiment mutinied and
went "Red" at Viborg in Finland.  Scantily clad,
he had escaped his would-be assassins, fleeing
bare-footed into the darkness of the Finnish winter night.
After many hairbreadth escapes he had gained
Swedish territory and safety.
</p>

<br />
BRITISH TRAINED PERSIAN POLICE.
</p>

<p>
There was also Captain George Eve, an
Anglo-Russian mining engineer, who came from South
America to enlist, and who, because of his accent
and foreign appearance, had been arrested more than
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
once in the front line in Flanders on suspicion of
being a German spy dressed in British uniform.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Smiles of the Armoured Car Section was
another interesting figure.  A descendant of Smiles
of "Self-Help" fame, he had won the D.S.O. and
the Cross of St. George while fighting with the
Locker-Lampson unit in Russia.
</p>

<p>
Where practically every second man had a record
of thrilling deeds behind him it is difficult to
individualize, but a word must be given to Colonel
Warden, D.S.O., of the Canadian Contingent.
"Honest John" was the affectionate nickname
bestowed upon him by the ship's company, who found
a special fascination in his childlike simplicity of
character combined with exceptional soldierly qualities.
</p>

<p>
Another refreshingly original type was Colonel
Donnan, the C.O. of the party.  Apart from other
things, his physical qualities seemed to mark him
out for the important post he occupied.  They were
calculated to strike terror into any Hun or other
heart.  A veritable Sandow, his burly thick-set
figure, black bristling moustache, and dark piercing
eyes were valuable assets for the man whose task
was to discipline such a mixed company as ours,
and the nurses affected an exaggerated terror of
them, well knowing (the minxes!) that they were
but the outworks of the fortress behind which was
entrenched the Colonel's kind heart&mdash;outworks apt
to go down like ninepins when assailed by a woman's
tearful pleadings.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
</p>

<p>
Colonel Donnan is one of the strong, silent
Englishmen who have done so much in an unostentatious
way to push the interests of the British Empire in
the far-off places of the earth.  A great Orientalist,
he has passed through many Eastern lands in disguise,
bringing back precious fruits of his labours in
a store of information, both military and political,
gathered in his journeyings.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Malwa</i> boasted an amphibious purser named
Milman.  For three and a half years, ever since the
war began, he had been sailing up and down the seas
from London to Rio, and from Bombay to Liverpool,
and he knew from personal contact the summer and
winter temperature of the Mediterranean Sea better
than did any meteorologist from collected data.  In
fact, he had been torpedoed so many times that he
had begun to look upon it as part of the routine of
his daily life.  He possessed a life-saving suit, his
own improved design, which was at once the wonder
and admiration of all who inspected it.  It was of
rubber, in form not unlike a diving dress, with a
hood which came over the head of the wearer and
was made fast under the chin.  In front were two
pockets, which always remained ready rationed with
a spirit-flask, some sandwiches, and a pack of patience
cards.  It was the purser's travelling outfit when he
was overboard in the Mediterranean or elsewhere and
waiting to be hauled on board a rescue boat.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally when, in harbour, time hung heavily
on his hands, this amphibious purser would clothe
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
himself in his rubber suit, slip over the ship's side,
and go off for an outing.  Once in Port Said, while
gently floating off on one of these aquatic excursions,
he was sighted by the port guardship, and a
picket-boat was sent to fish him out under the impression
that he was dead.  "This bloke is a gonner all
right!" said one of the crew, as he reached for him
with a boathook.  Then the "corpse" sat up and
said things.  So did the spokesman of the astonished
crew when, having recovered from the shock, he
found his voice again.
</p>

<p>
Milman was a cheery optimist.  Nothing ever
perturbed him.  He was a recognized authority on
"silver fish" (<i>i.e.</i>, torpedoes) and cocktails, was an
excellent raconteur, and possessed all the suavity and
tact of a finished diplomat.  When nervous ladies
worried the doctor and cross-examined him as to
the habits and hunting methods of Hun submarines,
he invariably passed them on to the purser, and
always with the happiest results; for, under the
spell of Milman's racy talk, they soon forgot their
fears.
</p>

<p>
The second day out from Taranto brought us well
within the submarine danger zone.  We changed
course repeatedly, for wireless had warned us of the
proximity of the dreaded sea pirate.  The <i>Tagus</i>,
our fellow transport, proved herself a laggard; she
was falling behind and keeping station badly, and
the Commodore of our Japanese escort was busy
hurling remonstrances at her in the Morse code.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
Our three Japanese destroyers made diligent and
efficient scouts.  They gambolled over the blue
waters of the Mediterranean like so many
sheepdogs protecting a moorland flock.  Now one or
another raced away to starboard, then to port, then
circled round and round us, took station amidships,
or dropped astern.
</p>

<p>
Their tactics, perhaps one should say their antics,
must have been extremely baffling, even exasperating,
to any enemy submarine commander lying low in
the hope of bagging the <i>Malwa</i> or the <i>Tagus</i>.  Nothing
seemed to escape the keen-eyed sailors of the Mikado's
navy.  Experience had taught them the value of
seagulls as submarine spotters.  Endowed with
extraordinary instinct and eyes that see far below the
surface of the sea, the resting gulls detect a
submarine coming up anywhere in their vicinity, take
fright, and hurriedly fly away.  Whenever the gulls
gave the signal&mdash;and there were many false alarms&mdash;a
Japanese destroyer would race to the spot in
readiness for Herr Pirate; but he never appeared.
</p>

<p>
However, the Hun was not always so cautious.
There was great rejoicing on board the <i>Malwa</i> when
the wireless told us that west of us, in the Malta
Channel, Japanese vigilance had been rewarded,
transports saved from destruction, and two enemy
submarines sent to the bottom.  It was all the work
of a few minutes.  Whether the enemy failed to sight
the destroyers, or whether they intended to chance
their luck and fight them, is not quite clear.  At all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
events, Submarine No. 1 popped up dead ahead of
one destroyer and was promptly rammed and sunk.
Submarine No. 2 met with an equally unmistakable
end.  It had already singled out a transport for
attack, when a second Japanese destroyer engaged
it at seven hundred yards' range and blew its hull
to pieces.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless it was an anxious time for us on the
<i>Malwa</i> living in hourly dread of being torpedoed.
The Nursing Sisters professed to treat the danger
with scorn; they were courageous and cheery souls,
and would unhesitatingly have faced death with the
equanimity of the bravest man.
</p>

<p>
Ten in the forenoon and five in the afternoon were
the hours of greatest peril, when submarine attacks
might be specially expected.  Everyone "stood to"
at these hours, wearing the regulation lifebelt, and
ready to take to the boats if the ship were hit and
in danger of sinking.  Colonel Donnan, C.O. ship,
was a strict disciplinarian.  He enhanced the
somewhat piratical ferocity of mien with which nature
had gifted him by always carrying his service revolver
buckled on and ready for any emergency, and the
Nursing Sisters professed to be in great trepidation
each time at inspection parade when he ran his
critical eye over their life-saving equipment.  Of
course knots sometimes went wrong, and the strings
of the life-belt were tied the incorrect way; but
volunteers were never lacking to adjust the erring
straps and to see that they sat on a pretty pair of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
shoulders in the manner laid down in Regulations,
while the ferociously tender-hearted C.O. smiled
approval.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth day after leaving Taranto the <i>Malwa</i>
steamed into Alexandria Harbour.  Everyone was
in the highest spirits.  We had escaped the
submarine peril, and the period of nervous tension while
waiting in expectancy of a bolt from the deep was
happily over.  It was a glorious spring day; the
warm, radiant sun of Egypt gave us a fitting welcome.
</p>

<p>
The stay in Alexandria of the Bagdad Party was
short.  Orders came through from headquarters that
we were to proceed to Suez by rail as soon as possible
to join a waiting troopship there.  That night there
were many tender leave-takings in quiet secluded
nooks on the upper deck of the <i>Malwa</i>.  During our
four days' journey from Taranto the Australians on
board had proved themselves to be as deadly effective
in love as they are in war.  But now had come the
parting of the ways, with the pain and bitterness of
separation.  Perhaps a kindly Fate may reunite some
of these sundered ones, but for many that can never
be.  At least three of those bright, cheery Australian
lads sleep in soldiers' graves beneath the soil of
Persia, far from their own South Land and from the
girls to whom they plighted their troth that last
night in the harbour of Alexandria beneath the
starry Egyptian sky.
</p>

<p>
General Byron, his orderly officer, and myself left
the same evening for Cairo en route for Suez.  Next
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
day we had time to obtain a fleeting glimpse of the
Pyramids, take tea at Shepheards', and be held to
ransom by an energetic British matron who ordered
us to "stand and deliver" in the name of some
philanthropic institution which had not the remotest
connection with the War or any suffering arising
out of the War.  The General furnished the soft
answer that turneth away wrath, and with that, plus
a small contribution for supplying wholly unnecessary
blankets to the aboriginal inhabitants of some tropical
country, we were allowed to retain the remainder of
our spare cash and to continue our journey in the
Land of Egypt.

CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
EGYPT TO THE PERSIAN GULF
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Afloat in an insect-house&mdash;Captain Kettle in
command&mdash;Overcrowding and small-pox&mdash;The s.s. <i>Tower of Babel</i>&mdash;A shark
scare&mdash;Koweit.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Forty-eight hours after disembarking at Alexandria
we were steaming down the Gulf of Suez on board a
second transport bound for the Persian Gulf.
</p>

<p>
It would be difficult to imagine a greater contrast
than that between the vessel which brought us across
the Mediterranean and the one that was now carrying
us towards the portals of the Middle East.  The
latter was a decrepit steamer, indescribably filthy,
which had been running in the China trade for a
quarter of a century.  Though favoured by the
mildest of weather, the old tub groaned in every
joint as she thumped her way down the Red Sea
towards the Indian Ocean.  Long overdue for the
scrap-heap, when the war broke out she was turned
into a transport, and thenceforth carried cargoes of
British troops instead of Chinese coolies.  Her decks
and upper works were thickly encrusted with dirt,
the careful hoarding of years; and a paint-brush had
not touched her for generations.  Her cabins were
so many entomological museums where insect life
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
flourished.  In the worm-eaten recesses of the
woodwork lurked colonies of parasites gathered from
every corner of the globe, fighting for the principle
of self-determination of small nations.  The
bathroom door, held in place by a single rusty hinge,
hung at a drunken angle, and the inflow pipe of the
bath was choked with rust.  At night, as you slept
in your bunk, playful mice, by way of establishing
friendly relations, would nibble at your big toe, and
a whole family of cockroaches would attempt new
long-distance-sprinting records up and down the
bedclothes.
</p>

<p>
The Captain of the ship was a sharp-featured
ferret-eyed individual who sometimes wore a collar.
No one knew his exact nationality, but he bore a
tolerable resemblance to Cutcliffe Hyne's immortal
"Captain Kettle."  Indeed, he was said to cultivate
this resemblance by every means in his power.  He
had a pointed, unshaven chin; he wore a much-faded
uniform cap tilted over one ear.  On the bridge you
would see him with hands thrust deep in his trouser
pockets and chewing a cigar.  As master of a tramp,
he had nosed his way into almost every port in both
hemispheres.  He had traded from China to Peru,
and along the Pacific Coast of America.  In his
wanderings he had acquired a Yankee accent and a
varied and picturesque polyglot vocabulary which,
when the floodgates of his wrath were opened, he
turned with telling effect upon his Lascar crew or
his European officers.  He was a man of moods and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
strange oaths, a good seaman with a marked taste
for poker and magazine literature of the cheap
sensational kind.
</p>

<p>
Such, then, was our ship, and such its skipper!
When we had arrived at Suez, where we embarked,
there were several cases of smallpox amongst its
Lascar firemen.  The Embarkation Officer had feared
infection, and had hesitated to send us on board;
but he was overruled by a higher authority
somewhere in Egypt or England.  There was no other
transport available, it was said; the units for India
and for Persia were urgently needed; and, smallpox
or no smallpox, sail we must&mdash;and did.
</p>

<p>
The ship was terribly overcrowded.  The Indian
troops "pigged it" aft; the British troops were
accommodated in the hold; and those of the officers
who were unable to find quarters elsewhere
unstrapped their camp bed and slept on deck.
Fortunately it was the cool season in the Red Sea; the
days were warm, but not uncomfortably so; and the
nights were sharp and bracing, the head-wind which
we carried with us all the way to Aden keeping the
thermometer from climbing beyond the normal.
</p>

<p>
Once clear of Suez everybody settled down to
work, a very useful relief to the discomforts of life
on an overcrowded transport.  Youthful subalterns
joining the Indian Army set themselves to study
Hindustani grammars and vocabularies with the
valiant intention of acquiring colloquial proficiency
before they even sighted Bombay.  Members of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
Bagdad Party, stimulated by this exhibition of
industry, tackled Persian and Russian.  We had two
officers who offered themselves as teachers of the
language of Iran&mdash;Lieutenant Akhbar, a native-born
Persian whose English home was at Manchester, and
Captain Cooper of the Dorsets, who had studied
Oriental tongues in England, and had been wounded
at Gallipoli in a hand-to-hand fight with the Turks.
</p>

<p>
For Russian also there was no lack of teachers,
the Russian officers, Captain Eve, and I taking
charge of classes.  In my own section, elementary
Russian, I had twenty-two N.C.O.'s as eager and
willing pupils.  The majority were Australians, and,
although dismayed at first by the bizarre appearance
of the unfamiliar characters, and the seemingly
unsurmountable difficulties of what one Anzac aptly
described as "this upside-down language," they put
their backs into it with very remarkable results,
plodding away at their lessons hour after hour with
unwearying zeal.  Some had picked up a smattering
of "Na Poo" French on the Western Front; a few
spoke French fairly well; but the majority knew no
foreign language at all; yet the quick alert Australian
brain captured the entire Russian alphabet in forty-eight
hours after beginning the preliminary assault.
</p>

<p>
I have sometimes thought since that to the Gods
on High our ship must have appeared a sort of
floating Tower of Babel, so intent on speaking strange
tongues were each and all.
</p>

<p>
Before we reached the Indian Ocean, one of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
ship's officers disappeared in a mysterious manner.
He was missed from the bridge at midnight and,
although diligent search was made, no trace of him
was ever found, and it had to be assumed that he
had jumped or fallen overboard.  Our Goanese
stewards who were Christians looked upon this
incident with the greatest misgivings.  Knowing the
superstitions of the Lascar crew, they secretly felt
that the missing officer had been thrown overboard
by some of them to placate a huge shark that had
been following the ship for days.  The Lascars have
a great dread of such company at sea.  To their
untutored minds this voracious brute following a
vessel foretells death to someone on board; so better
a sacrificial victim than perhaps one of themselves!
</p>

<p>
Personally, I do not think for a moment that
Lascar superstition was responsible for the
disappearance of the missing man, nor that these people
are given to the propitiation of the Man-Eaters of
the Red Sea.  But when, two nights later, one of
the Lascars vanished as mysteriously as had the
ship's officer, and this too in calm weather, it looked
as if some Evil Spirit had found a place on board.
Stewards and crew now became terrified.  The former
would not venture alone on the deck at night, and
the Lascars, sorely puzzled over the fate of their
comrade, went about their work in fear and trembling.
</p>

<p>
This dread of the mysterious and the unseen
became contagious and affected others outside the
ship's company.  Subalterns who had been sleeping
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
on hammocks slung close to the ship's rail and whose
courage had been proved on many a field, now
decided that, shark worship or no shark worship, they
would be safer elsewhere, and transferred themselves
to the 'tween decks.  Anyhow, the Sea Demon must
by this time have been satisfied, for we lost no more
of our personnel.
</p>

<p>
We arrived off Koweit in the Gulf of Persia on
March 1st, seventeen days after leaving Suez.
</p>

<p>
Koweit, or Kuwet, is an important seaport on the
Arabian side at the south-west angle of the Persian
Gulf, about eighty miles due south of Basra, our port
of destination.  Kuwet is the diminutive form of
Kut, a common term in Irak for a walled village,
and the port lies in the south side of a bay twenty
miles long and five miles wide.  Seen through our
glasses it did not seem a prepossessing place, for the
bare stony desert stretched away for miles behind the
town.  Yet only by accident had it escaped greatness.
In 1850 General Chesny, who knew these parts
by heart, recommended it as the terminus of his
proposed Euphrates Valley Railway; and, when the
extension of the Anatolian Railway to Bagdad and
the Gulf was mooted, Koweit was long regarded as a
possible terminus.  But the War altered all that,
and it is doubtful now if Koweit, which lives by its
sea commerce alone, will even achieve the distinction
of becoming the terminal point of a branch line of
the railway which is destined to link up two continents.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Turks and Germans have long had their eyes
open to the great possibilities of Koweit.  The former
in 1898 attempted a military occupation, but were
warned off by the British, and abandoned their
efforts to obtain a foothold in this commercial
outpost of the Gulf, while the ruling Sheikh was sagacious
enough to be aware of the danger of Turkish absorption,
and to avert it by placing his dominions under
the protection of Great Britain.  The German-subsidized
Hamburg-Amerika Line made an eleventh
hour attempt to capture the trade of the Gulf, and
in the months immediately preceding the War devoted
special attention to Koweit and Basra trade, carrying
freight at rates which must have meant a heavy
financial loss.  It was all part of the German
Weltpolitik to oust us from these lucrative markets of
the Middle East, and to secure for German shipping
a monopoly of the Gulf carrying trade.  With the
German-controlled Bagdad Railway approaching
completion, one shudders to realize what would have
been our fate economically, if the sea-borne trade
of Basra and Koweit had passed under the flag and
into the hands of the enterprising Hun.
</p>

<p>
Basra lies about eighty miles to the north of
Koweit.  It is here that the Shatt el Arab (literally
the river of the Arabs, or, otherwise, the commingled
Euphrates and Tigris) empties itself into the Persian
Gulf.  Vessels with a greater draught than nineteen
feet cannot easily negotiate the bar.  Our own
transport was bound for Bombay, so it was with a feeling
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
of thankfulness that we quitted her for ever and
were transferred to a British India liner, the <i>Erinrupy</i>,
which since the beginning of the War has been used
as a hospital ship.  She was spick and span, and the
general air of cleanliness was so marked after the
filthy tub that had conveyed us from Suez that we
trod her decks and ventured into her cabins with an
air of apologetic timidity.
</p>

<p>
It was half a day's run up river to Basra.  Next
morning we were speeding along with the swirling
brown waters of the Shatt el Arab lapping our
counter, the land of Iran on our right, and that of
Irak on our left.  It grew warmer, and there was a
good deal of moisture in the air.  The low flat shores,
cut up by irrigation canals, were covered by
date-palm groves.  Dhows and other strange river craft,
laden with merchandise, dotted the surface of the
brown waters, and the glorious green of the foreshores
was a welcome relief to eyes tired of the arid
sterility of the Arabian shore.  A few miles below
Basra we steered a careful course, passing the sunken
hulls of two Turkish gunboats which the enemy had
submerged in the fairway in the hope of blocking
the river channel and preventing the victorious
British maritime and war flotillas from reaching
Basra.  Like most other operations undertaken by
the Turks the effort was badly bungled, and the
channel was left free to our ships.

CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
THE CITY OF SINBAD
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Arrival at Basra&mdash;A city of filth&mdash;Transformation by the
British&mdash;Introducing sport to the natives&mdash;The Arabs and the cinema.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Basra or Busra, the Bastra of Marco Polo, and for
ever linked with the adventures of Sinbad the Sailor,
is one of the most important ports of Asiatic Turkey,
and sits on the right bank of the Shatt el Arab a
short distance below the confluence of the Tigris
and the Euphrates.
</p>

<p>
It is built on low-lying marshy land where the
malarial mosquito leads an energetic and healthy
life.  Basra proper is about a mile from the river,
up a narrow and malodorous creek, and when the
tide is out the mud of this creek cries out in strange
tongues.  The natives, however, seem to thrive upon
its nauseating vapours.  It is at once the source of
their water supply and the receptacle for sewerage.
In this delectable spot, as indeed throughout Asiatic
Turkey and Persia, sanitary science is still unborn,
and the streets are the dumping-ground for refuse.
</p>

<p>
The long, narrow bellem, with its pointed prow, in
general appearance not unlike a gondola, is the
chief means of communication between the Shatt
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
el Arab and Basra itself.  If the tide is low, the
Arab in charge poles up or down stream, and when
you arrive at your destination you generally pick
your way through festering mud to the landing-place.
</p>

<p>
One's first feelings are of wonder and bewilderment
that the entire population has not long ago
been wiped out by disease.  Going up and down
stream at low tide I have seen Arab women rinsing
the salad for the family meal side by side with others
dealing with the family washing.  Then the bellem
boy, thirsty, would lean over the side of the craft,
scoop up a handful or two of the water, and drink it.
As successors to the dirty and lazy Turk the British
in occupation of Basra have set themselves to remedy
this state of affairs, but it is uphill work.  Manners
and customs of centuries are not easily laid aside,
and your Asiatic sniffs suspiciously at anything
labelled Sanitary Reform, while the very mention of
the word Hygiene sounds to him like blasphemy
against the abominations with which he loves to
surround himself.  The Turk never bothered his
head whether the inhabitants lived in unhealthy
conditions.  When an epidemic broke out and carried
off a certain proportion of the population, the Turkish
Governor would bow his head in meek resignation
before the inscrutable will of Allah.
</p>

<p>
The architecture of Basra is of a distinctly primitive
type.  The houses are built chiefly of sun-dried
bricks, and the roofs are flat, covered with mud laid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
over rafters of date-wood and surrounded by a low
parapet.
</p>

<p>
Basra had been used as the British base for the
advance against the Turks on the Tigris.  From here
had been rationed the army and the guns that
reconquered Kut and opened the difficult road to
Bagdad.  The magician's wand of the British
soldier-wallah wrought wonders in the place.  Malarial
swamps were filled in, and hospitals and administrative
buildings erected.  Wharves equipped with giant
cranes sprang into being on the quayside, and, as
we were landed, the busy river scene, with fussy
tugs towing huge laden barges, and the quayside
packed with transports, irresistibly recalled some
populous port in the Antipodes or Britain itself,
rather than the seaside capital of a vilayet in Asiatic
Turkey.
</p>

<p>
That Basra had a great future in store for it as a
shipping centre was early recognized by
Major-General Sir George McMunn, who for some time
held the post of Inspector-General of Lines of
Communications at Basra.  He was one of those rare
soldiers with a genius for organization and a capacity
for bringing to bear upon big problems a wide range
of outlook, and he was never hampered by those
military trammels which often mar the professional
soldier and make a good general an exceedingly bad
civil administrator.  So General McMunn set to
work to give Basra an impetus along the path of
commercial progress.  He planned a model city
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
which was to include residential and business sites,
electric tramways, modern hotels, and public parks.
It was a stupendous undertaking, but McMunn
accomplished much in the face of great financial
difficulties.  He endowed Basra with a first-class
hotel run by a chef and an hotel staff recruited from
London, installed electric light, gave the evil-smelling
town a vigorous spring-cleaning, and with stone
quarried in Arabia buried beneath stout paving the
slimy mud of some of the Basra streets.
</p>

<p>
Ashar which fronts the Shatt el Arab is really the
business centre of Basra.  Its bazaars running parallel
with Basra Creek are dark, evil-smelling, and
over-crowded by human bipeds who swarm about ant
fashion, and are born, live, and die in these purlieus.
</p>

<p>
In the course of an hour during the busy part of
the day you can count on meeting representatives
of all the races and creeds of Asia in the streets
and bazaars of Ashar or lower Basra.  Here ebbs
and flows the flotsam of the East&mdash;Jews, Arabs,
Armenians, Kurds, Persians, Chaldeans (merchants or
traffickers these!), and coolies from India, Burma,
and China, with wanderers from the remote khanates
of Russian Turkestan, the latter in quaint headdress
and wearing sheepskin coats whose vicinity is rather
trying to sensitive noses when the thermometer is
well above eighty in the shade.
</p>

<p>
General Byron, with Major Newcombe of the
Canadian Contingent, Captain Eve, some other
members of our party, and myself were quartered in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
the old Turkish cavalry barracks, while the remainder
went into camp at Makina, two miles out.  The
Turks, it is true, were gone never to return, but in
the honeycombed recesses of the crumbling
dust-covered walls of Ashar barracks their troopers had
left behind many old friends who, from the very first,
displayed an envenomed animosity towards us, and
attacked British officers and men with a vigour
which the Turkish Army itself had never excelled.
Every night raiding parties, defying alike our
protective mosquito nets and the poison-gas effect of
Keating's, found their way into our beds; and every
morning we would crawl from between the sheets
bearing visible marks of these night forays.
</p>

<p>
It is always said, and generally believed, that the
British signalize their occupation of a country by
laying down a cricket pitch and building a church.
They did all these things and more at Basra.  There
was a garrison church, a simple building with a
special care for the temperature of a Gulf Sunday.
There were several sports clubs, and one at Makina,
which might be called the suburb of Ashar, had good
tennis courts.  Beyond, in the desert, was a racecourse
where the local Derby and Grand National were
run off.
</p>

<p>
The ordinary native of Iran and of the "Land of
the Two Rivers" has not hitherto shown any marked
taste for either mild or violent physical exercise.
But Basra, I found, was a noted exception to this,
and youth of the place were badly bitten by the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
sports mania.  As the doctors would say, "the
disease spread with alarming rapidity, and spared
neither young nor old."  After a few weeks devoted
to picking up points as spectators at "soccer"
matches, a native team would secure possession of a
rather battered football and start work, "Basra
Mixed" trying conclusions with "Ashar Bazaar," for
example.  The rules were neither Rugby nor
Association, but a local extemporization of both; and the
dress was not the classic costume of the British
football field, but a medley of all the garbs of Asia.
Stately Arabs in long flowing robes, suffering from
the prevailing sports fever, would forget their dignity
to the extent of running after a football and trying
to kick it.  Chaldean Christian would mingle in the
scrum with Jew and Mussulman.  Individual players
sometimes received the kick intended for the ball.
Off the field this would have led to racial trouble
and perhaps bloodshed, but as a rule these slight
departures from the strict football code were accepted
in the best possible spirit, being regarded no doubt
as part of the game itself.
</p>

<p>
Of course things did not always run so smoothly.
Sometimes the ball was entirely lost sight of, and
lay lonely and isolated in some corner of the field,
while the players would resolve themselves into a
sort of Pan-Asian congress on the ethics of games in
general.  Everyone spoke at once and in his own
tongue.  On such occasions a passing British soldier
would be summoned to assist at the deliberations,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
and in "Na Poo" Arabic would straighten out the
tangle.  Then play would be resumed, everybody
bowing to the superior wisdom of the soldier sahib,
and accepting his decision unquestioningly.
</p>

<p>
The youth of Basra, more precocious than their
elders, converted the streets of Ashar into a playing-ground
where tip-cat, bat and ball, marbles, diabolo,
and sundry other forms of juvenile recreation found
eager devotees at all hours of the day in narrow streets
generally crowded with army transport.
</p>

<p>
The cinema also exercised a great influence on the
native mind.  Never quite understanding its working,
he accepted it all philosophically as part of the
travelling outfit of that strange race of infidels from
far away who had chased the Turks from the shores
of the Arabian Sea, who seemed to be able to make
themselves into birds at will, and who rushed over
the roadless desert in snorting horseless carriages.
Men such as these were capable of anything, and
when the first cinema film arrived, the Arabs filled
to overflowing the ramshackle building which served
as a theatre.  In Basra I often went to the cinema,
not so much for the show itself as to watch the joy
with which that primitive child of nature, the Arab,
followed the mishaps and triumphs of the hero through
three reels.  How they were moved to tears by his
sufferings!  And how they shouted with joy when
the villain of the piece was hoist by his own petard
and his career of rascality abruptly and fittingly
terminated!
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
</p>

<p>
One thing, I found on talking to some of these
native onlookers, puzzled their minds exceedingly,
and that was the morals and manners of European
women as shown on the screen.  The Arab is a
fervent stickler for the conventionalities, and it was
a great shock to his religious scruples to see women
promenading in low-necked dresses with uncovered
faces, frequenting restaurants with strange men not
their husbands, and imbibing strong drink.  "The
devil must be kept busy in Faringistan raking all
these shameless creatures into the bottomless pit!"
said one Arab to me, when I asked him what he
thought of the cinema.  It was useless to seek to
explain that cinema scenes did not represent the
real life of the Englishman or the American, and
that all our women do not earn their living as cinema
artists.
</p>

<p>
In Basra I never saw a Mohammedan woman
frequenting a cinema performance.  Even had she
won over her husband's consent to such an innovation,
public opinion would veto her presence there,
and she would not be permitted to look upon this
devil's machine illustrating foreign "wickedness."

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
AT A PERSIAN WEDDING
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Visit to the Sheikh of Mohammerah&mdash;A Persian banquet.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A few miles below Basra, on the Persian shore, at
the point where the Karun River joins the Shatt el
Arab, are the semi-independent dominions of the
Sheikh of Mohammerah.  His territory is part and
parcel of the moribund Persian Empire, but the
Sheikh has long held independent sway, and has
ruled his little kingdom with Oriental grandeur and
benevolent despotism.  He is a firm and convinced
friend of the British, and even at the darkest hour
of our military fortunes in the Gulf, when it seemed
as if we might be driven from the lower Tigris itself,
the Sheikh was proof against Turkish intrigue and
the corrupting influence of Hun gold.
</p>

<p>
His Excellency the Khazal Khan, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E.,
to give him his full title, like most Persian potentates
in the tottering, crumbling Empire of Iran, where the
writ of the present "King of Kings" does not run
beyond the walls of Teheran, held undisputed sway
over his little state, and his authority was enforced
by a nondescript army of retainers.  But he was a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
generous host, a firm friend, and an unforgiving
enemy.
</p>

<p>
One week-end while at Basra I was one of a few
British officers invited to assist at the elaborate
festivities which precede a Persian marriage.  The
contemplated matrimonial alliance was intended to
unite the family of the Sheikh and that of Haji Reis,
his Grand Vizier or Prime Minister.  In the small
party that dropped down the river on one of His
Majesty's gunboats, were the Admiral of the Station,
one or two generals, the Political Officer, the liaison
officer between the Indian Government and the ruler
of Mohammerah, and my friend Akhbar, a Persian
from Manchester who had joined up early in the War.
As we dropped down stream past the Palace, a
salute was fired in our honour by the Sheikh's
artillery-men with a couple of old six-pounders.  An
antediluvian Persian gunboat dipped her ensign as we
steamed past.  It was the first time I had seen a
warship or indeed any other vessel flying the Persian
flag, and I regarded her with interest.  Akhbar, who
despite his British uniform and his long residence
amongst us, remained always an ardent Persian,
professed to be very much hurt by some chance
observations of mine directed at the river gunboat
and the Persian navy in general.
</p>

<p>
The Palace was a rectangular building, with
stuccoed front, standing back from the water and
approached by a winding stone staircase.  On landing
we were received by the chief dignitaries of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
place with the Grand Vizier at their head.  There
was much bowing and salaaming, and it was here
that I first made acquaintance with that elaborate
code of official and social ceremony which surrounds
every act of one's life in Persia.  A guard of honour
from the Sheikh's household troops made a creditable
attempt to present arms as we stepped ashore.  More
soldiers lined the stairway leading to the reception
room.  They wore a variety of uniforms, and were
armed with everything in the way of rifles, from
antiquated Sniders to modern Mausers and
Lee-Enfields.  Like most of the irregulars that we
encountered in Persia afterwards, they fairly bristled
with bandoliers stuffed full of cartridges.  A Persian
on the war-path, be he tribal chief or simple armed
follower, is generally a walking arsenal.  He is full
of lethal weapons which nearly always include a rifle
of some kind and a short stabbing sword with an
inlaid hilt.  He often displays a Mauser pistol as
well, and usually carries enough ammunition hung
round him to equip a decent-sized small-arms
factory.
</p>

<p>
The Sheikh himself received us in the main
reception hall, which was covered with rare Persian
carpets, any single one of which would be worth a
small fortune in London.  The Prime Minister and
his son, we found, spoke excellent English, and the
former, who was wearing the conventional frock coat
of the Occident, but no shirt collar, presented each
visitor in turn to our Arab host, a man just past
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
middle life with all the stately grace and dignity of
his Bedouin forebears.  He was dressed in native
costume; his manners were easy and full of charm.
He had a dark, olive-tinted face, black beard and
wonderful lustrous black eyes.  A strict adherent of
the Shi'ite sect, and an abstainer from strong drink
himself, he was, nevertheless, not averse to supplying
it to his Western guests.  The Grand Vizier during
his sojourn in Europe had evidently studied our
customs and civilization <i>au fond</i>.  Apart from a
knowledge of the English language and literature, he
had brought back with him a fine and discriminating
taste in the matter of aperitifs, knew to a nicety the
component parts of a Martini cocktail, and was a
profound connoisseur of Scotch whisky.  Our party
had few dull moments with the Grand Vizier as
cicerone, and our admiration for his versatility rose
by leaps and bounds.
</p>

<p>
The dinner was <i>à la fourchette</i>.  It is not always
so in hospitable Persia where, as a rule, host and
guests sit in a circle on the floor and help themselves
with the aid of their fingers.  Here everything had
been arranged in European fashion, and the long
table was topped by a rampart of specially prepared
dishes with a lavishness that was truly Oriental.  It
is a Persian custom to supply five times more food
than one's guests can possibly consume.  What
remains becomes the perquisite of the servants of the
household.
</p>

<p>
According to Persian etiquette a son may not sit
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
down in the presence of his father, so the bridegroom-elect
had no place at the board, and his active
participation in the banquet was limited to carrying out
the duties of chief butler and waiting upon the guests.
It was hot and exhausting work, in the intervals of
which he liberally helped himself from a black bottle
which stood on a table behind the Grand Vizier's
chair.  Barefooted servitors passed nimbly along the
table, and saw to it that their master's guests wanted
for nothing.  A plate was emptied only to be speedily
replenished.
</p>

<p>
We saw nothing of the bride-to-be.  She played
but a minor part in the evening's entertainment.
Nor were any other women of the household to be
seen.  At one end of the banqueting hall was a
heavily curtained aperture.  Occasionally this was
furtively drawn aside an inch or two, and a woman's
veiled face would appear for an instant, and as
quickly disappear.  It was the private view allowed
to the bride and her girl friends.
</p>

<p>
The menu was inordinately long.  Dish succeeded
dish, and eat we must unless we wished to cause
dire offence to our host.  He himself, seated
at the middle of the table, ate sparingly and
drank but water, his air of quiet impassivity
giving place to a smile from time to time as he
listened to some Persian <i>bon mot</i> or other from one
of his neighbours.
</p>

<p>
The Sheikh excelled as a host.  No sooner was the
banquet at an end than he told us that a display of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
fireworks had been arranged in our honour.  Seats
had been placed for the visitors on the long veranda
at the back of the palace and facing the extensive
grounds.  No Persian feast is held to be complete
without a pyrotechnic display of some kind, and that
organized for our pleasure would have done credit
to the best efforts of Brock or Pain.
</p>

<p>
There were Catherine-wheels, rockets, and welcoming
mottoes in Persian and English which flared
up merrily, until the whole grounds were one blaze
of light.
</p>

<p>
The retainers entered fully into the spirit of the
affair.  Clad in fireproof suits, they were hung round
with squibs which were set alight, and then the
human Catherine-wheels carried out an astonishing
series of somersaults, to the intense delight of the
native portion of the audience.  An English gunnery
instructor, aided by native workmen with material
from the Sheikh's arsenal, had been responsible for the
pyrotechnic part of the entertainment.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the banqueting hall had been
cleared, and presently we were conducted thither,
where, to the strains of a Persian orchestra, native
dancing boys showed their skill in a series of
emotional and highly sensuous gyrations.  These youths
were of a distinctly effeminate appearance in their
long flowing Persian robes, and there was a look of
brazen abandon in their more than suggestive
evolutions as they whirled round and round on the
floor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
</p>

<p>
To these succeeded a quartette of Armenian girls
in bright-hued raiment and low-necked dresses, their
bare bosoms covered with cheap jewellery, their hair
and costumes studded with glittering sequins, and
their ankles encircled by gilt metal bracelets giving
them an air of tawdriness and unspeakable vulgarity.
Their movements were graceful, with a certain artistic
crudeness.  To the clash of cymbals, and with a jingling
of their sequins and anklets, two would whirl round
the dancing hall, until sheer physical exhaustion
compelled them to seek a temporary respite on a
divan; whereupon they would be succeeded on the
floor by the other pair who had been awaiting their
turn.  This dancing by relays went on until the
early hours of the morning, and we began to be
alarmed lest it should continue for the duration of
the War.  Etiquette forbade us to leave, so we did
our best and stuck it out to the end.  In the
tobacco-laden atmosphere, with the temperature distinctly
sultry, and the windows hermetically sealed I made
a desperate but ineffectual attempt to fight off
drowsiness.  At last I succumbed and dreamt that
I was in the Paradise of Mahomet listening to the
music of the houris entertaining some of the newly
arrived Faithful.
</p>

<p>
I woke with a start, for someone had prodded me
in the ribs and told me it was time to go, and by a
swift transition I found myself back at Mohammerah
and our party bidding adieu to our kindly host and
his Grand Vizier.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
</p>

<p>
It was too dark to attempt the passage of the
river back to Basra, so we crossed over to the house
of Mr. Lincoln of the British Consulate on the right
bank of the Karun river and spent the remainder of
the night under his hospitable roof.

UP THE TIGRIS TO KUT
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Work of the river flotilla&mdash;Thames steamboats on the
Tigris&mdash;The waterway through the desert&mdash;The renaissance of
Amarah&mdash;The river's jazz-step course&mdash;The old Kut and the
new&mdash;In Townshend's old headquarters&mdash;Turks' monument
to short-lived triumph.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Our stay at Ashar barracks was of brief duration.
A week after landing in Basra we received orders from
General Headquarters to proceed to Bagdad
immediately, but steamer accommodation was limited,
and it was found impossible to embark the whole of
our party at once.  However, a compromise was
effected with the Local Embarkation Officer, and
place was found on an up-river steamer for our first
contingent, consisting of General Byron, twenty-four
other officers (of whom I was one), and forty
N.C.O's.
</p>

<p>
Our transport was an antiquated paddle steamer,
broad of beam, and the whole of her one deck
was packed with troops bound for up-river like
ourselves.  In addition, she towed, moored on
either side, two squat barges filled with troops and
supplies.
</p>

<p>
The navigation of the Tigris, even in peace time,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
when the river is unencumbered, is a hazardous
undertaking.  Its lower reaches are flat and winding,
and when it is in flood the banks are submerged.
The stream follows an erratic course, occasionally
striking out on an entirely fresh one, and the search
for the new channel is often attended with disaster
for the daring river mariner.  Yet up and down the
stream between Kut and Basra British seamen have
zigzagged their way by sheer pluck and perseverance,
dumping down men and supplies at the advanced
base with unfailing regularity.  The admirable part
played by these river skippers of the Tigris has never
been told, and so has never been properly appreciated
by their countrymen at home.  Day and night they
toiled to hurry up the needed reinforcements to the
hard-pressed battle line in Mesopotamia, and to
feed the army that was driving the Turk from the
"Land of the Two Rivers."  Drawn from all parts
of the Empire, they worthily represented the pluck,
courage, and unyielding tenacity of the British race.
Had it not been for the river skippers of the Tigris,
shy, unostentatious men, sparing of speech and
indifferent to praise, the Mesopotamian Campaign must
have ended abortively; Kut could never have been
retaken, and the Turks would still have been in
Bagdad.
</p>

<p>
The despatches of victorious generals in Mesopotamia
have been full of references to valuable aid
and service rendered by units and individuals, but,
it seems to me, they have entirely overlooked the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
great contribution of the men of the Tigris River
Flotilla, who have apparently been left without
reward or recognition.
</p>

<p>
In the waterway of the Shatt el Arab itself, and
before we entered the Tigris proper, we passed scores
of river craft.  There were dhows laden to the
gunwale with river produce being carried swiftly down
by the current towards Basra market.  Here was
an antiquated sternwheeler with her lashed barges
alongside, like an old woman with parcels tucked
under her arms, going to the base to load up supplies.
And, most wonderful of all, here was a London
County Council steamer, the <i>Christopher Wren</i>, which
had abandoned the Thames for the Tigris and the
carrying of happy trippers from Blackfriars to Kew
for the transporting of Mr. Thomas Atkins and his
kit part of the long river journey towards Bagdad.
Some of the Tommies on our steamer eyed her
enviously.  Here was a touch of the far-distant
homeland under Eastern skies!  There was a
suspicion of a tear in some sentimental eyes, but the
wag of the party scored a laugh when he megaphoned
with his hands to the skipper of the Wren, "I'm for
Battersea, I am!"
</p>

<p>
A number of these L.C.C. boats had come out
from London under their own steam, making the
long voyage to the Gulf and Basra through the Bay
of Biscay and across the Mediterranean and Red
Seas, buffeted by wind and wave, but without losing
any of their personnel or suffering any material
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
damage.  It was a triumph of seamanship and
British pluck.
</p>

<p>
The banks of the Tigris, and indeed of the
Euphrates, at certain seasons of the year are surely
the most desolate places on the habitable earth.
The date-palm plantations of the Shatt el Arab are
succeeded by a monotonous landscape of dull brown
desert stretching away as far as the eye can see.
To our right, as we wound and twisted our way up
river, we occasionally caught a glimpse of the
snow-clad mountains of Persia.  Dotted here and there
along the banks are Arab villages, which seemed to
be a conglomeration of goats, sheep, and dusky-brown
naked children, all thrown confusedly into the
picture.  By way of variation, now and then we
swept past a desert oasis, where stood a few stunted
palm-trees near which a tribe of nomads had set up
their black tents of goat's-hair and were spending a
week-end on the river bank before trekking afresh
into the heart of the desert.
</p>

<p>
Your real Arab nomad is essentially a child of
nature.  He spends his life in the wilderness and has
a rooted objection&mdash;nay, it is, in truth, a positive
terror&mdash;to visiting any town, big or little.  He has
an undefinable dread of venturing within a walled
city, apparently regarding it in much the same way
as a wild bird would regard an iron-barred cage.
Any restriction of movement is irksome to him.  He
loves the free life of the desert, with its limitless
possibilities, its far-stretching horizon, and its absence
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
of streets and houses.  He is of the tribe of Ishmael,
destined to wander on and on, ever remote from the
haunts of his fellow-man.
</p>

<p>
The semi-nomad, on the other hand, is less
intractable, and does not chafe so much under the
yoke of Western civilization.  He is frugal, sober,
and thrifty.  We passed hundreds of his tribe who
live on the banks of the Tigris, cultivating a patch
of arable land, and using a wooden plough which
must have been old-fashioned even in the days of that
earliest recorded agriculturist, Cain.
</p>

<p>
We groped a tedious way along the sinuous Tigris,
missing by a foot or two a down-river steamer and
its lashed barges, making fair headway against the
swirling waters which swept past us with the speed
of a millstream.  The current carried us from side to
side, first bumping one bank, and then cannoning
against the opposite one, until it seemed as if the
stout lashings of our captive barges must be torn
away.  Where the river was especially narrow, we
would tie up to the bank and give right-of-way to a
convoy going down stream.  At night, too, we would
either tie up or anchor inshore, and at daylight
would be off again.
</p>

<p>
In the bright clear atmosphere it was possible to
see objects many miles distant.  Ofttimes we would
catch sight of a steamer away to our right or left,
looking for all the world as if she were making an
overland trip and was stuck fast in the middle of the
waterless desert.  But the seeming mystery was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
explained by the winding course of the river, which
can only be likened to a series of figures of eight.
</p>

<p>
It took us about thirty hours to reach Amarah,
which lies on both banks of the Tigris and, by reason
of its position, had become an important coaling-centre
on the lower part of the stream.  There was
an air of bustle and activity about the place, for
British organization had descended upon it and
rudely awakened it from the sleep of centuries.
British military and native police controlled the
town, and kept the more mischievous of the unruly
Arab elements in order.  A swing-bridge had been
thrown across the river to carry vehicular traffic.
River steamers were moored at the quays, taking in
or discharging cargo, and Indian and Arab coolies
sweated in the sun as they hurried along with great
burdens on their backs.
</p>

<p>
Our way to camp led through the Bazaar, which
may, I think, lay claim to be one of the filthiest and
most malodorous in all the "Land of the Two Rivers."  It
had rained heavily the previous night, and now
the unpaved roadway through the main bazaar was
a foot deep in liquid mud.  The average native was
wholly unconcerned and, while we picked our steps
carefully, mentally consigning Amarah and its
abominable streets to perdition, barefooted Arab women,
wearing anklets of silver, with a pendant through one
nostril, and in their finest raiment, would plod
contentedly through this mire as if it were a rose-bestrewn
path.  Tiny mites with no more clothing than a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
string of beads gave each other mud baths with the
joy and enthusiasm of children sporting in the sea
at some European watering-place.
</p>

<p>
Still, if Amarah disgusted us with its muddy streets
and evil-smelling bazaars, it had some compensating
advantages, amongst them its British Officers' Club.
In a desert of dirt and discomfort this was a veritable
oasis, with its excellent cuisine, and smoking and
reading rooms provided with the latest three-months-old
newspapers and magazines.  It stands on the
river front, and from its roof-garden a fine panorama
opens at one's feet.  In the foreground are the busy
river and the crowded quayside, and on the opposite
bank the white tents of the British camps blend with
the dark green of the date-palms.  Still farther
beyond, as a background to the picture, is the
dun-brown of the desert wastes.
</p>

<p>
A wet camp is at all times an abomination, and our
first night at Amarah was not a pleasant experience.
The transit camp is on a sort of peninsula, and a few
hours' rain converted it into a lake of mud.  We
were housed in huts whose shape recalled a miniature
Crystal Palace, and whose semi-circular sides and
roof were thatched with palm netting.  In the hut
which I shared with Major Newcombe and Captain
Eve, during the early hours of the morning a heavy
shower poured through the roof as if it were a sieve.
In the darkness there was a scramble over the muddy
floor in quest of waterproof sheets and raincoats
with which to set up a second line of defence for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
our leaky roof.  Afterwards we all laughed heartily
at the experience, but at the time we were inclined
to be wrathful, for an unexpected and unlooked-for
shower-bath in bed at 2 a.m., even on active service,
may ruffle the mildest of tempers.
</p>

<p>
From Amarah to Kut we went by river, the journey
occupying three days.  The military-constructed
railway which has since been opened does the journey
in ten or twelve hours.  Our steamer, No. 95, was a
comfortable one of her class for Tigris river
travelling.  Indeed in this part of the world she would
be listed as de luxe, inasmuch as she possessed cabin
accommodation and actually had a bathroom.  The
trip itself was but a slight variation of the monotonous
river journey to Amarah.  There were the same flat
stretches of country now and again relieved by a
few palm-trees; the white tents of a British river
guard, a link in this long-drawn-out line of
communications; or some Arab village with its grouping
of dilapidated palm-roofed huts, its barking curs,
and its mud-brown naked children.  Occasionally
down by the banks there was a fringe of green where
some native cultivator, aided by the water from an
irrigation canal, was rearing a hardy spring crop.
</p>

<p>
As on its lower reaches, the river pursued a devious
path across the face of the country until one grew
giddy with attempting to follow its windings.  The
Tigris is a most impulsive stream; it obeys no will
but its own, and is as erratic as any river of its size
in the world.  However, as Kut is approached on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
up journey, it broadens out into noble proportions,
swift and deep, and for a few miles behaves rationally,
abandoning its geographical jazz-step over the
Mesopotamian plains.
</p>

<p>
Kut&mdash;the scene of Townshend's immortal stand,
with his handful of troops diminished daily by famine
and disease, holding off to the last a powerful enemy&mdash;is
situated at the end of a tongue of land at a point
where the Tigris, taking a mighty sweep, mingles its
waters with those of the Shatt el Hai.
</p>

<p>
But a new Kut, a British Kut, a town of tents
and wooden huts and galvanized iron buildings, has
sprung into being three miles below the tottering
walls of Turkish Kut, and about two miles from
Townshend's advanced trench line.  In British Kut
there are rough wooden piers, hastily built, it is true,
where the river steamers moor, few attempting the
difficult passage from Kut to Bagdad.  Kut is also
an important railway junction, for the troops bound
up river were disembarked here, and stepped from
the steamer deck into the waiting troop-trains.
</p>

<p>
We went up river in a motor launch, General
Byron, Major Newcombe, Captain Eve, and myself,
to visit Townshend's famous stronghold.  It was
with a feeling of emotion that we disembarked at the
old stone pier of Kut, and made our way along its
broken unpaved streets, past its crumbling wall, to
the centre of the town.  The route led through the
main business centre&mdash;it could hardly be called a
bazaar&mdash;where merchants and money-changers plied
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
their trades, and a blind beggar in rags sat under the
lee of a wall, with the sun shining full on his sightless
eye-sockets, droning a supplication for alms.  The
wave of red war had passed and repassed over Kut,
leaving it scorched and maimed.  Turk and Briton
had fought for supremacy round and about it, but
that was more than a year ago, and Kut now dozed
sleepily in the hot afternoon sun, beginning already
to forget the past and, with the calm philosophic
indifference of the East, accepting as a predestined
part of its daily life the Standard of Britain which
had replaced the Crescent of the Turk.
</p>

<p>
The Arab policemen who guarded its unkempt
streets were serving their new masters faithfully, and
those we passed, spick and span in spotless khaki
and tarbooshes, by their alert and soldierly bearing
gave unmistakable evidence of having graduated from
the school of that efficient, exacting, and most
conscientious of mortals, the British drill instructor.
</p>

<p>
Presently, guided by a Staff Officer from the base
headquarters, we came to the house of the Hero of
Kut.  It was an unpretentious dwelling, flat-roofed,
and built of sun-dried bricks, with nothing much
to distinguish it from its hundreds of neighbours.
Descending a steep flight of steps, we came to the
Serdab or underground apartment common to most
Mesopotamian houses, where the occupants hide for
shelter during the hottest hours of the blistering
summer day.  The room was bare of adornment&mdash;a
few chairs, a divan, and a table covered with official
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
papers&mdash;that was all.  It was now the home of the
local Political Officer, but it had changed little, if
any, since its former illustrious occupant walked out
of it and up those stone steps&mdash;his proud spirit
unbroken, his heart heavy, but his courage undimmed&mdash;to
pass a captive into the hands of the Turks.
</p>

<p>
None of our party could lay any special claim to be
sentimental but, standing there in the narrow
underground room with its hallowed associations, where a
very gallant British General, the foe without and
disease and hunger within&mdash;he, too, alas! another
victim of high-placed incompetency&mdash;planned and
schemed during those dark days of the siege to break
the throttling grip of the Turk, we felt we were upon
holy ground, and every one of us, moved by a common
emotion, raised our hands to our caps in salute.  It
was our tribute of admiration and respect for
Townshend and his heroes&mdash;for the men who perished
so nobly, no less than for their comrades maimed
and broken who survived the fall of Kut, many of
them, unhappily, only to pass anew through the gate
of suffering and to end their lives as prisoners in
the hands of a brutal, ungenerous enemy to whom
honour and compassion are meaningless terms.
</p>

<p>
It was not every day that the Turks could boast
such a victory as Kut, or that they found themselves
with a British General and a starving British force
surrendering to their arms.  Short-lived as was their
triumph, they lost no time in celebrating it by setting
up a commemorative monument.  This stands on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
Tigris' bank close to British Kut and the landing
pier, and is in the form of an obelisk of unhewn
stone on a plinth of corresponding material fenced
in by an iron railing.  A few obsolete cannon, the
muzzles facing outwards, are grouped round the base
of the monument.  An inscription in Turkish records
the fall of Kut and the capture of Townshend and
his men which, it recounts, was accomplished by the
grace of Allah and the prowess of the besieging
Turkish Army.
</p>

<p>
The next stage of our journey from Kut to Bagdad
was a short one.  A night in a troop-train, and
sunrise the following morning saw us being dumped
down at Hinaida Camp on the outskirts of the City of
the Caliphs.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
BAGDAD
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Arabian nights and motor-cars&mdash;The old and the new in
Bagdad&mdash;"Noah's dinghy"&mdash;Bible history illustrated&mdash;At a famous
tomb-mosque.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Who has not heard and read of Bagdad, of its
former glory and its greatness?  I set foot in it for
the first time on March 20th, 1918, the day after the
arrival of our little party at Hinaida Transit Camp
on the left bank of the Tigris.
</p>

<p>
As I tramped across the dusty Hinaida plain
towards the belt of palm groves which veils the city
on the east, I had visions of Haroun al Raschid, and
fancied myself coming face to face with the wonders
of the "Arabian Nights."  It was with something
of a shock, then, that on entering the city I
encountered khaki-clad figures, and saw Ford vans
and motor lorries tearing wildly along the streets.
In the main thoroughfare, hard by British
Headquarters, a steam roller was travelling backwards and
forwards over the freshly metalled roadway,
completing the work of an Indian Labour Corps; farther
on, a watering cart labelled "Bagdad Municipality"
was busily drowning the fine-spun desert dust that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
had settled thickly on the newly born macadamized
street.  Here was an Arab café, with low benches on
the inclined plane principle like seats in a theatre,
where the occupants sipped their Mocha from tiny
cups, or inhaled tobacco-smoke through the amber
stem of a hubble-bubble, watching the passing show,
and betimes discussing the idiosyncrasies of the
strange race of unbelievers that has settled itself
down in the fair city which once had been the pride
of Islam.
</p>

<p>
Truly a city of contrasts!  Cheek by jowl with the
Arab café was an eating-house full of British soldiers.
The principal street runs parallel with the river and,
as one proceeded, it was possible to catch glimpses
of pleasant gardens running down to the water's
edge and embowering handsome villas&mdash;gardens where
pomegranates, figs, oranges, and lemons grew in
abundance.  The Oriental readily adapts himself to
changing circumstances, and unhesitatingly abandons
the master of yesterday to follow the new one of
to-day.  Already traces of the Ottoman dominion
were being obliterated.  The Turkish language was
disappearing from shop signs to be replaced by
English or French, with, in some cases, a total
disregard of etymology, such choice gems as "Englisch
talking lessons," "Stanley Maude wash company"
(this over a laundry), "British tommy shave room,"
showing at all events a praiseworthy attempt to
wrestle with the niceties of the English language.
</p>

<p>
Bagdad as I saw it in the first days following my
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
arrival struck me as a place whose remains of faded
greatness still clung about it.  No one could deny
its claim to a certain wild beauty which age, dirt,
and decay have not been able wholly to eliminate.
The glory of the river scene is unsurpassable.
</p>

<p>
To see Bagdad at its best one must view it from
the balcony of the British Residency (now General
Headquarters).  Here, as you look down upon the
river, the old bridge of boats connecting with the
western bank is on your right, and handsome villas
where flowers grow in profusion, the residences of
former Turkish officials or wealthy citizens, adorn
the foreshore.
</p>

<p>
The river is broad and majestic, and strange craft
dot its surface.  Here is a Kufa, in itself a link with
antiquity, a circular boat of basketware covered with
bitumen, sometimes big enough to hold ten men and
two or three laden donkeys.  Its cross-river course
is decidedly eccentric.  Propelled by crudely
fashioned paddles wielded by sturdy oarsmen, its
progress from shore to shore is leisurely and
cumbersome as, caught into the eddying current, it twirls
slowly, with a rotatory movement, like the dying
motion of some giant spinning-top.
</p>

<p>
The cheerful Thomas Atkins promptly christened
the kufa "Noah's Dinghy," and lost no time in
getting afloat therein.  Some of the Australians at
Hinaida Camp organized a kufa regatta, the course
being across river and back, a distance of about two
miles.  A waterproof sheet was attached as a sail
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
by one enterprising Anzac, but even that did not
help to accelerate very appreciably the snail-like
progress of his aquatic tub.  Local tradition avers
that Sinbad the Sailor came spinning down from
Bagdad to Basra in a kufa, when he signed on at
the Gulf port for his first ocean voyage.  Who
knows?  Kufas are depicted on some of the old
Assyrian monuments.
</p>

<p>
A close relative surely to the Kufa is the Kellik
or Mussik raft of the upper Tigris.  Constructed of
a square framework of wood buoyed by inflated goat-skins,
it is widely utilized as a cargo carrier on these
inland waterways.  Piled high with hay and a
miscellaneous collection of live-stock, it will waddle
off down river with a crew of three or four, and half
a dozen or so passengers.  Sometimes the cargo
shifts, or the goat-skin bladders become deflated,
and the kellik, down by the nose or stern, grows
more unwieldy than ever.  A little mishap of this
kind never bothers the crew.  They steer for some
convenient point on the river-bank where the water
is shallow, unhitch the defective skins, and inflate
them afresh with the unaided power of their own
lungs.  The cargo righted, and the trim of their
cumbersome raft restored, they will push off into
midstream and continue their venturesome journey,
logging a steady two knots.
</p>

<p>
But on an upstream trip it is another story.  Then
the laden or empty kellik has to be towed, and hard
work it is to make headway when the river is in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
flood and racing down to meet its brother, the
Euphrates, on their joint way to the Gulf.
</p>

<p>
Going upstream the kellik keeps as close in shore as
possible.  Two men in the boat keep her from going
aground, while a couple of others yoke themselves
to a towline and move along the margin of the stream
much like the canal bargees in Holland.  But on the
Tigris there is no well-defined towing path, and the
course resolves itself into a kind of zigzag cross-country
obstacle race, and the agility and dexterity
with which these muscular native rivermen harnessed
to the towline of a heavily laden raft will negotiate
sunken ground, canal ditches, tumble-down village
walls, and a few other natural hazards on a stretch
of Tigris' river-bank, is extraordinary to behold.
The life of a galley slave in Carthage must have been
a soft snap indeed compared with that of the
dark-skinned toilers who tug at an up-river kellik under
the full force of a Mesopotamian sun.
</p>

<p>
Bagdad as a city takes us back to the horizon
rim of the world's history.  There still clings to it
an air of musty antiquity and prehistoric dirt which
the efforts of its new masters, the British, with
pick-and-shovel sanitary science, and other new-fangled
inventions of Western civilization, have not entirely
eradicated.  The beardless invaders from over the
seas have sought to scrape clean its ancient bones,
to straighten out the kink in its narrow, tortuous,
and evil-smelling streets, and to let the light of day
and a little wholesome fresh air penetrate into the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
gloom and dampness of its rabbit-warren of a bazaar.
Staid, solemn-looking citizens, with the green turban
of Mecca enveloping their venerable heads, whose
ancestors probably drifted in here when overland
travel was resumed after the Flood, have looked on
in pious horror while festering slum areas have been
laid low by British pickaxes.  These Hadjis, fervent
believers in tradition, and uncompromising opponents
of innovation, have caressed their beards thoughtfully
when confronted with the new order of things,
and come to the philosophic conclusion that, as
Kipling has it, "Allah created the English mad, the
maddest of all mankind."
</p>

<p>
Biblical history is no longer vague and shadowy,
but takes on a new meaning and an added significance
to anyone who explores old Bagdad with eyes to see.
As I wandered through its bazaars in quest of
antiquities and bargains in bric-à-brac and rare
damascened weapons, I often forgot the primary
object of my visit while strolling silently about
contentedly studying the hastening crowds who elbowed
and fought their way along the narrow streets, or
watching the complacent shopkeepers who sat cross-legged
in their narrow, cell-like shops, haggling over
prices with some prospective buyer.  It was like
throwing Biblical romance and Biblical tragedy on a
cinema screen, only that now it lived and was real
flesh and blood.  Here were the descendants of the
Jews of the Captivity&mdash;shrewd-looking, sharp-featured
merchants, traffickers in gold and silver,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
dealers in antiquities, a living link between that very
remote yesterday and the modern to-day, amassing
much wealth in the land of their perpetual exile,
carrying on unbrokenly the religion and traditions of
Judaism&mdash;in dress, manners, customs, and speech as
unchanged and unchanging as on the day when the
heavy hand of the Babylonian oppressor smote their
forbears and they were led away into slavery.
</p>

<p>
And here, too, now competing in commercial
rivalry with the sons of Abraham, are lineal descendants
of Assyrians, Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, and
of those other warring races who between them
made history in the long ago.
</p>

<p>
The descendants of the Jews of the Captivity have
never wandered far afield, and it would even seem
that they have preferred exile to repatriation.  Bagdad
formed part of Babylonia, and a three hours' train
journey to Hilleh on the Euphrates will land the
Bagdad Jew of an archæological turn of mind amidst
the ruins of ancient Babylon.
</p>

<p>
The Jew venerates Bagdad as a sort of lesser Zion.
It was long the seat of the Exilarch, and is still the
rallying centre of Eastern Judaism.  Monuments
and tombs of the mighty ones of the Chosen Race
are scattered over Lower Mesopotamia.  There is the
reputed tomb of Ezra on the Shatt el Arab near
Korna, that of Ezekiel in the village called Kefil,
while the prophet Daniel has a holy well bearing his
name at Hilleh near the ruins of Babylon.  But the
chief place of pious pilgrimage for Bagdad Jews lies
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
in a palm grove an hour's journey from the city on
the Euphrates road.  Here is said to be buried
Joshua, son of Josedech, a high priest towards the
end of the captivity period.
</p>

<p>
Western Bagdad, on the right bank of the Tigris,
always recognizing and rendering a somewhat sullen
obedience to the sway of the Turkish Sultan, is
separated from Eastern Bagdad by much more than
the deep waters of the river.  Its inhabitants for the
most part are Mohammedans of the Shi'ite sect, as
opposed to the orthodox or Sunni creed of the Turks.
The Shias may be described as Islamic dissenters,
and their cult is the state religion of Persia.
Ethnologically and politically they are closer akin to Iran
than to Turkey, and their eyes are more frequently
turned to Teheran than to Istambul.  In Western
Bagdad they have their own mosques, their own
bazaars, and their own shrines, and lead lives more
or less isolated from their Asiatic brethren on the
opposite side of the river.
</p>

<p>
During a visit to the famous Shi'ite mosque and
shrine at Kazemain, a suburb of the Western City,
I found that the people, while outwardly friendly and
polite, were much more fanatical than the average
Sunni Mussulman, and were inclined to resent any
attempt on the part of a Giaour like myself to see
the interior of their mosques and shrines.  I had for
companions General Byron and Lieutenant Akhbar,
the latter a professing Shi'ite.  We crossed by the
new pontoon swing bridge which now connects the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
two shores, superseding the old bridge of boats of
Turkish days.
</p>

<p>
The houses are huddled together, and are squat
and meanly built, with the low encircling walls and
roofed parapets of sun-dried mud so common to
Persian villages.  The streets are barely wide enough
for two pedestrians to pass abreast, and are full of
holes or covered with garbage.  As for the inhabitants,
they were miserably clad, and the few women
whom we chanced to encounter in our path hastily
stepped aside and, turning from us, made a furtive
effort to veil themselves by covering the upper part
of their faces with a dirty piece of rag produced from
the voluminous folds of a sleeve-pocket.
</p>

<p>
We did not tarry here very long.  Quitting this
waterside hamlet we drove three miles to Kazemain
itself, passing en route the terminus of the
Bagdad-Anatolian Railway, that great link of steel in the
chain of German world-expansion the completion of
which, under the existing concession, would have
been commercially and economically fatal to us in
Western Asia.
</p>

<p>
The tomb-mosque of Kazemain is one of the architectural
landmarks of Bagdad.  Its twin domes and
its four lofty minarets, all overlaid with gold, are
visible for miles as the traveller approaches Bagdad
from the west.  When the rays of the noonday sun
strike on these gilded cupolas and graceful tapering
columns it enhances their beauty a hundredfold,
and throws into bold relief all their harmony and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
symmetry.  It recalled to me vividly, but in a minor
degree, some of the wonder and the glory of that
other great monument of an Eastern land&mdash;the Taj
Mahal at Agra.  But while the one is secular and
commemorative of earthly love, the other has a deeply
religious significance, for in the imposing mosque of
Kazemain are buried Musa Ibn Ja'far el Kazim and
his grandson, Ibn Ali el Jawad, the seventh and
ninth of the successors of Ali, the son-in-law of
Mahomet, and recognized by the Shias as the rightful
Caliphs of Islam.  As a centre of pilgrimage for
Shi'ite Moslems, Kazemain ranks second after Kerbela,
the tomb of Hosain the Martyr; and from the point
of view of sanctity, Kazemain is considered to take
even higher place than either Samarra or Nejef, the
other two Shi'ite shrines in the Vilayet of Bagdad.
</p>

<p>
The customary crowd of beggars, maimed, halt,
and blind, whined to us as we alighted before the
great gate of Kazemain Mosque.  Three or four small
boys, who had stolen a free ride by clinging to the
back of the automobile while it crawled dead slow
through the gloomy, winding streets of the bazaar,
now demanded a pishkash (the Persian equivalent of
backsheesh).  Mollahs, Sayyeds, and other reputed
holy men, springing apparently from nowhere, formed
a ring around us, deeply interested in our dress, our
speech, the colour of our hair, and our beardless faces.
More especially was the wondering attention of the
crowd concentrated on Akhbar, himself a native
Persian, holding the King's commission and wearing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
the King's khaki.  "What manner of man is this?"
asked the puzzled onlookers.  "Is he Infidel or True
Believer? for, by the Beard of the Prophet, he
speaks our holy tongue as well as we do ourselves!"
</p>

<p>
Now there intervened an elderly personage in the
Abba or flowing robes affected by the better class
of Persian, with a green kamarband indicating his
claim to lineal descent from the Prophet.  The
new-comer, whose hair and beard were plentifully dyed
with henna&mdash;a never-failing sign, I was assured, of
virtue and virility&mdash;offered to go in search of the
Mujtahid or Chief Priest.
</p>

<p>
He returned presently with that important
functionary, who salaamed, but looked at us coldly and
suspiciously, I thought.  A whispered colloquy now
took place between himself and Akhbar.  He had no
doubt as to the heterodoxy of the General and myself,
but, on the other hand, at first he was not convinced
of the orthodoxy of Akhbar, this professed Believer
clad in Infidel garb.  All Akhbar's impassioned
pleading failed to move him.  Akhbar himself might enter
freely, but as for the two Unbelievers, they must not
set foot within the jealously guarded portals of the
holy place.
</p>

<p>
Up to this point the negotiations had been
singularly free from anything even remotely connected
with coin of the realm.  I think it was the Mujtahid
himself who, in his most winning manner, hinted
that "Blessed is he that giveth," and that even the
dole of an Unbeliever might win merit in the sight
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
of Allah.  We gave accordingly, whereupon the
Mujtahid, out of the kindness of his heart, and by
way of requiting our generosity, said he would enable
us to see something of the Shi'ite "holy of holies."  With
himself as guide we were led by a circular route
to a caravanserai for pilgrims which stood close to
the high wall of the mosque.  The place was
untenanted, but, mounting by a flight of rickety stairs
to the flat and somewhat unstable roof, we were able
to overlook the interior courtyard of the mosque,
to note its gilt façade, and to watch the worshippers
performing their ablutions at the fountain in the
centre of the courtyard.  With this we had to be
content.
</p>

<p>
The Shrine down to recent days had been a sanctuary
for criminals fleeing from justice, but the
Turkish overlords, it is said, when a fugitive happened
to be of sufficient importance, were able by cajolery
and bribery to override Sanctuary and secure the
man they wanted.  In consequence, Kazemain lost
its popularity with fugitive law-breakers.
</p>

<p>
The populace at the termination of our visit gave
us a hearty send-off, and the beggars, whose
persistence and persuasiveness it was difficult to resist,
having relieved us of sundry krans and rupees, called
down the blessing of Allah on our heads.
</p>

<p>
The Sunni Moslems have many imposing places of
worship in Bagdad.  The Mosque of Marjanieh is
noted for its very fine Arabesque work, bearing
considerable resemblance to the ornamentations on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
Mosque at Cordova, in Spain.  There is also the
Mosque of Khaseki, which is believed to have been
once a Christian Church.  Its Roman arch, with
square pedestals and its spirally-fluted columns,
reveal an architectural school that is not Oriental.
</p>

<p>
Outside the walls of the Western City is the reputed
site of the tomb of Zobeide, the wife of Haroun al
Raschid.  The eroding hand of Time has dealt heavily
with this once splendid mausoleum, but its curiously-shaped
pineapple dome is still intact, and survives
proudly amongst the ruin and decay of a dead-and-gone
civilization.  Niebuhr, the German traveller
who visited this tomb in the middle of the eighteenth
century, says he discovered an inscription setting
forth that it was the site of the ancient burying-place
of Zobeide, but that about 1488, Ayesha Khanum,
wife of a Governor of Bagdad, was also given sepulture
there.  Doubt is thrown upon the historical accuracy
of Niebuhr by many scholars, and there is a legend
that Zobeide was buried at Kazemain.

CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
EARLY HISTORY OF DUNSTERVILLE'S FORCE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Jealousy and muddle&mdash;The dash for the Caspian&mdash;Holding on
hundreds of miles from anywhere&mdash;A 700-mile raid that
failed&mdash;The cockpit of the Middle East&mdash;Some recent politics in
Persia&mdash;How our way to the Caspian was barred.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Bagdad is not a pleasant place of residence when the
Sherki, or south wind, blows, and when at noonday
the shade temperature is often 122 degrees Fahr.  For
Europeans, work is then out of the question, and it is
impossible to venture abroad in the scorching air.
There is nothing for it but a suit of the thinnest
pyjamas and a siesta in the Serdab or underground
room which forms part of most Bagdad houses.  The
local equivalent of a punkah is usually to be found
here, and this helps to make life just bearable during
the hot season.
</p>

<p>
At Headquarters and administrative branches there
was a welcome cessation of labour from tiffin time
until after the great heat of the day.  But the late
Sir Stanley Maude, when in chief command at Bagdad,
demanded a very full day's work from his staff, and
suffered no afternoon siesta.  He set the example
himself, and on even the hottest days was absent
from his desk only during meal hours.  Maude,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
splendid soldier and genial gentleman that he was,
boasted of an iron constitution which was impervious
alike to Mesopotamian heat and Mesopotamian
malaria.
</p>

<p>
The cool weather had already set in when the
Bagdad party took up its abode under canvas at
Hinaida.  We found already there an earlier
contingent which had been gathered together from units
serving in Mesopotamia and Salonika.  No one knew
quite what to do with us, and General Headquarters
was seemingly divided in mind as to whether
we should be treated as interlopers, and interned for
the duration of the War, or left severely alone to
work out our own salvation, or damnation, as we
might see fit.  The latter view carried the day, and
our welcome in official quarters was therefore
distinctly chilling.  The difficulty chiefly arose, it
appears, because General Dunsterville, the leader of
our expedition, had been given a separate command,
and was independent of the General commanding-in-chief
in Mesopotamia.  Jealousy was created in high
quarters.  There was a spirited exchange of telegrams
with the War Office, in which such phrases as "Quite
impossible of realization," "Opposed to all military
precedent," are said to have figured prominently.
</p>

<p>
In February, in the middle of the rainy season,
and while the snow still lay thick upon the Persian
mountain passes, General Dunsterville had collected
some motor transports and, taking with him a handful
of officers, had made a dash for the Caspian Sea.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
His intention was to seize and hold Enzeli, the
Persian port on the Caspian, in order either to bluff
or to beat the Russian Bolsheviks there into
submission, and to use it as a base for operations against
Baku, which had become a stronghold of
German-Turkish-Bolshevik activity.
</p>

<p>
After untold difficulties, one party crossed the
rain-sodden Persian uplands, hewed a road over the
snow-covered Assadabad Pass for their Ford cars,
and, although severely tried by cold and hunger,
succeeded in reaching Hamadan.  Leaving a small
band of men there to keep the unfriendly Persian
population in check, Dunsterville pushed on for
Kasvin, and thence to Resht, a few miles from Enzeli,
brushing aside the stray bands of armed marauders
that sought to bar his progress.
</p>

<p>
The goal was in sight, but, unsupported, and
without supplies, and hundreds of miles from his small
party at Hamadan, he found himself unable to hold
on.  His enemies were numerous and well-armed.
Awed at first by the appearance of this handful of
British officers who had unconcernedly motored into
their midst after a seven-hundred-mile raid across
Mesopotamia and Persia, the Bolsheviks and their
German-subsidized Persian auxiliaries were for
temporizing&mdash;nay, they even invited the British General
to a conference to discuss the situation; and, in the
hope of arriving at the basis of an understanding,
Dunsterville accepted the invitation to confer with
them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
</p>

<p>
In the meantime his enemies had not been idle.
Their spies were quick to report that no British
reinforcements were arriving.  Dunsterville's numerical
weakness was apparent, and the drooping spirits
of the Bolshevik Council revived.  It had been cowed
into inaction, but now it grew bold, and its attitude
became menacing.  The British General was presented
with an ultimatum demanding his immediate
withdrawal on pain of capture and death.
</p>

<p>
There was no help for it.  Withdraw Dunsterville
must, and did.  The Ford cars carrying the daring
raiders sped away from the Bazaar of Resht and
back to Hamadan, and through streets crowded with
armed and hostile ruffians ripe for any crime.
</p>

<p>
This, briefly, was the situation in the early days of
March.  Dunsterville had leaped and failed.  He
was back at Hamadan, holding on tenaciously, with
a small body of officers and N.C.O.'s, no men, lacking
supplies, from which he was separated by hundreds
of miles of roadless country made doubly impassable
by rain and melting snow, and threatened with
extermination by unfriendly tribesmen who,
wolf-like, were baying round him, eager yet afraid to
strike.

</p>

<p>
But, one will ask, what were Dunsterville and his
force doing in Persia at all?  And why had Britain,
who had gone to war with Germany because the latter
had overrun neutral Belgium, and who had professed
so much horror for Germany's aggression, why had
she, of all nations, violated Persian neutrality,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
invaded Persian territory, and ignored Persian protests?
The answer is simply that we entered Persia to
defend Persian rights as much as to defend our own
cause and the cause of the Allies.  The territory of
the Shah had been devastated by contending armies
of Turks and Russians.  It had been swept by fire
and sword; and now those twin handmaidens of
ruthless war, famine and disease, were abroad in
the land of Iran, slaying indiscriminately such of the
wretched helpless populace as had escaped the fury
and the sword of Turk and Muscovite.  Persia, by
reason of its geographical boundaries&mdash;its frontiers
being coterminous with those of Russia and Turkey&mdash;had
in the early part of the great world struggle
become the cockpit of the Middle East.  The weak,
emasculated Government of the Shah, a mere set
of marionettes, hopped about on the political stage
of a corrupt capital.  It had no will of its own; and,
even if it had, the constitutional advisers of the
"King of Kings" had no means of enforcing it.
</p>

<p>
Hating Russia politically, and perhaps not without
reason, coquetting with Turkey because of the
common religious bond of Islamism, Persia herself
very early in the War failed to observe the obligations
which neutrality imposed upon her.  She aided
and abetted the emissaries of the Central Powers.
Hun gold was the charm at which her gates flew
open to admit Prussian drill-instructors, whose business
was to organize and train the wild tribes of the
south-west for raids against our vulnerable right
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
flank in Mesopotamia.  The "Volunteers of Islam,"
a body of fanatical Mollahs with a leavening of
Turkish military officers and of bespectacled
professors of German Kultur, were recruited round Lake
Van in Turkish Armenia.  They had for their object
the preaching of a holy war in Afghanistan against
Britain, and the setting alight of our Indian
north-west territory.  The "Volunteers of Islam," moving
across the Persian frontier, established their base in
Persian Kermanshah preparatory to turning their
faces eastward in the long trek to Herat and the
scene of their Islamic and anti-British crusade.
</p>

<p>
They were destined never to behold the mountain
passes of their "Promised Land," for, valour
outrunning their discretion, these militants of Islam and
Potsdam, while engaged in the final preparations for
the journey to Afghanistan, were foolish enough to
throw in their lot with a Mesopotamian frontier tribe
which was thirsting to distinguish itself in battle
against the British.  The combat duly took place,
and the insolent tribesmen were punished for their
foolhardiness.  In fact, they found extinction, instead
of the looked-for distinction; and many "Volunteers
of Islam" were also given sepulture by the vultures,
the <i>concessionaires des tombeaux</i> in these parts.  As
for the survivors, they readily abandoned Kermanshah
for the greater security offered by the Armenian
highlands.
</p>

<p>
After the Russian military collapse in the winter
of 1917, followed by the Bolshevist triumph and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
signing of the shameful treaty of Brest Litovsk,
the Germans and their infamous allies, the followers
of Lenin and Trotsky, lost no time in making
themselves masters of the Caucasus.  Tiflis fell, and
arrayed itself under the Red Banner of National
Shame; Armenians, Georgians, and Tartars, all
victims of Turkish misrule, but hating each other
more cordially than they collectively hated the
Osmanli oppressor, wrangling over their respective
claims to independent nationhood, varied by the
absorbing passion of slitting each other's throats,
were all too busy to seek to make common cause
against the Bolshevik wolf when it appeared before
their fold in the guise of a German lamb.
</p>

<p>
Would that all these nationless peoples of the
Caucasus, who with so much vehemence are always
pleading their own inalienable right to self-determination,
possessed military gifts commensurate with their
brilliant, perfervid, never failing oratory!  If they
could fight only half as well as they can talk, what
unrivalled soldiers they would be!
</p>

<p>
The Bolsheviks and their German masters and
paymasters, coming down the railway line from
Tiflis, speedily possessed themselves of Baku and its
oil wells.  Immediately opposite Baku, and on the
eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, is Krasnovodsk,
the terminus of the Transcaspian Railway, that
important strategic line which links up the khanates of
Russian Turkestan, connects, on the one hand,
Samarkand with Orenburg and the main <i>reseau</i> of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
Russian railways, and, on the other, bifurcates and
comes to a dead stop&mdash;resembling the extended jaws
of a pincers&mdash;within hailing distance of the Afghan
frontier.  Once masters of the Caspian littoral and
of the Russian gunboats which patrolled its waters,
the Bolsheviks and their German allies were free to
use the Transcaspian Railway, and to menace India
seriously by way of Afghanistan.
</p>

<p>
At all events, they lost no time in invading Persia
from the sea by way of Enzeli.  Here they found
eager sympathisers and willing auxiliaries in the
Persian Democrats, a political party with considerable
influence and following in Resht itself and
throughout the Persian provinces of Gilan and
Mazandaran.  The Democrats laid claim to represent
the intelligentza of North-Eastern Persia.  Their
profession of political faith was, broadly, "Persia for
the Persians," the abolition of all foreign meddling
in Persian affairs, and the ending of the Russian and
British spheres of influence.  But it was against the
British that their virulent hatred and political
conspiracies were chiefly directed.  While they feared
the British, they despised the Russians.  As one of
the leaders of this "Young Persia Movement" said
to me when we had a heart-to-heart talk in Kasvin,
"To our sorrow we find that the British are honest
and incorruptible, therefore they are dangerous.
Should they decide to stay here, we could never hope
to turn them out.  On the other hand, to our joy
we recognize that neither the Russians nor the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
Turks possess these high moral attributes,
consequently there was always the hope that some day
we might be able to escort the last of them to the
frontier."
</p>

<p>
The "Young Persia" representative put his case
concisely, fairly, and without any tinge of political
jaundice.  None better than he realized the
impotency of the vacillating Teheran Government to
enforce its paper protests against the violation of
Persian neutrality.  Its only military instrument
was a ragged, unpaid, undisciplined rabble, which
international courtesy has been wont to designate
an Army.  The Persian Democrats therefore linked
up with the Bolsheviks.  But it would be erroneous
to assume that their ranks were recruited entirely
from disinterested patriots, inspired by the highest
altruistic ideals, burning to rid their country of the
foreigner&mdash;be he Briton, Turk, or Russian&mdash;in order
that Persia might be free to work out her own political
salvation in her own way and without interference
from anybody.  Some there were in the ranks of the
Democrats actuated only by love of country, as they
conceived it, who, with noble resolve in their hearts,
trod the financially unremunerative path which led
to the goal of political glory.  There was always
plenty of elbow-room and never any overcrowding
on this road.  The great majority of the Democrats,
as I found them, put pul (<i>i.e.</i>, money) before patriotism,
and for them a Turkish lira, or a twenty-mark
piece, had an irresistible attraction.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
</p>

<p>
With the downfall of Russia as a military power,
her Army, which had pushed down through Persia
in order to effect a junction with the British in
Mesopotamia, rapidly retreated, and as rapidly
disintegrated, smitten by the deadly plague of Bolshevism.
Discipline and organization were at an end; obedience
was no longer rendered to Army Chief, corps
commander, or regimental officer, but to the soldiers'
own "Red Committee"&mdash;usually with a sergeant at
its head&mdash;which, besides usurping the functions of
Generalissimo, became the Supreme War Council of
the Army, giving an irrevocable decision upon
everything from high strategy to vulgar plundering.  Now
two Russian generals, named Bicherakoff and Baratof,
appeared on the troubled stage of Persian politics.
From the debris of an army they had gathered round
them the odds and ends of stray Russian regiments,
bands of irregulars from Transcaucasia, and Cossacks
from the Don and the Terek&mdash;stout fighting men of
the mercenary type, whose trade was war and whose
only asset was their sword.
</p>

<p>
Both Bicherakoff and Baratof were loyal to the
cause of Imperial Russia and her Allies, and refused
to bend the knee to Lenin and Trotsky.  They were
willing to make war on our side as subsidized
auxiliaries.  In short, these heterogeneous cohorts were
for sale; they possessed a certain military value, and
the British taxpayer bought them at an inflated
price, and also their right, title, and interest, if any,
in the abandoned motor lorries, machine-guns, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
military stores of all kinds which littered the track
of the retreating, disorganized Russian Army.  The
British military treasure-chest also honoured a
proportion of the Russian requisition notes which had
been given to the extent of millions of roubles in
exchange for Persian local supplies, and which the
Persian holders knew full well would never be
liquidated by any Bolshevik Government in Petrograd
or elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Our friends, the Russians, having sold us their
supplies for the common cause, made some difficulty
about handing them over.  The soldiers, it was said,
claimed that war material was national property,
and objected to its appropriation unless they,
representing so many national shareholders, were each
paid on a cash basis a proper proportion of the
purchase price.  This was a deadlock that was never
satisfactorily adjusted.  Our new Russian allies also
offered to sell us the 160 miles of road from Kasvin
to Hamadan which had been constructed by a Russian
Company, and was being maintained by a system of
tolls levied upon goods and passengers.  But the
price was so formidable that, if we had closed with
the bargain, the British Exchequer would have
needed the wealth of Golconda to complete the
transaction.
</p>

<p>
Bicherakoff and his volunteers concentrated at
Kasvin, at the junction of the roads leading to Resht
and the Caspian in the north, to Tabriz in the
north-west, to Teheran in the south-east, and to Hamadan
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
and Kermanshah in the south-west.  Here they
imposed an effective barrier against the flowing tide
of Bolshevism coming from the Caspian, and it was
hoped that they might be able to keep open the road
from Kasvin to Resht and Enzeli.
</p>

<p>
The distance from Kasvin to Resht is about eighty
miles.  Half-way, at Manjil, there is a road bridge
over the Kizil Uzun River, and the country beyond
is covered with thick jungle, which fringes the
roadway on both sides.
</p>

<p>
About the time the Russians were sitting down in
Kasvin awaiting developments, there appeared in
the jungle country a redoubtable leader named
Kuchik Khan, who was destined to exercise
considerable influence on the military situation in the
region of the Caspian.  Kuchik Khan was a Persian
of a certain culture and refinement of manner,
endowed with courage, personal magnetism, and great
force of character.  He possessed, moreover, no little
knowledge of European political institutions and of
the science of government as practised in the West.
The personification of militant "Young Persia," he
proclaimed himself an apostle of reform.  Preaching
the doctrine of Persian Nationalism in the broadest
sense, he declared that he was the uncompromising
enemy alike of misrule within and interference from
without.  Recruits, attracted by good pay and the
prospects of loot, flocked to his standard from amongst
the harassed and overtaxed peasant population, and
were soon licked into tolerable military shape by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
German and Turkish officers.  Rifles, machine-guns,
ammunition, military equipment, and money were
also forthcoming from German sources.  His army,
which had its own distinctive uniform, grew rapidly,
and it was not long before Kuchik Khan found
himself strong enough to bid defiance to Teheran and
its feeble Government.  He set up as a semi-independent
ruler, and had his own council of political
and military advisers.  Kuchik Khan's tax-gatherers
collected and appropriated the Shah's revenues in
Gilan and in part of Mazandaran, and his power
became paramount from Manjil to the Caspian Sea.
The Jungalis, as his followers were called, under
German instruction became proficient in trench
warfare.  Selecting a good defensive position, they dug
themselves in along the Manjil-Resht road, and their
advanced outposts held the bridge head at Manjil
itself.

Kuchik Khan, as Persians go, was relatively
honest, and was possibly inspired by patriotic zeal;
but this did not prevent his becoming a pliant and
very useful military asset in the hands of the enemies
of the Entente Powers.  At their behest he bolted
and barred the door giving access to the Caspian
and for the British, at all events, labelled it, "On ne
passe pas!"

CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
OFF TO PERSIA
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Au revoir to Bagdad&mdash;The forts on the frontier&mdash;Customs house
for the dead&mdash;A land of desolation and death&mdash;A city of the
past&mdash;An underground mess&mdash;Methods of rifle thieves.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was not until the beginning of April (1918) that
the intermittent rainfall practically ceased, and
allowed a contingent of the weatherbound Dunsterville
party to turn their faces towards Hamadan,
where our General and his small force were said to
be in dire straits.
</p>

<p>
The advanced base near Baqubah on the Diala
River, north-east of Bagdad, where some of our unit
were under canvas, was a quagmire; and the road
beyond the Persian frontier was reported to be
impassable for man, motor, or animal transport.
But four consecutive days of fine weather effected a
transformation.  The heat of the sun converted the
liquid mud of the plains into half-baked clay, and
the road itself showed a hard crust upon its surface.
</p>

<p>
No time was lost in setting out for Persia.  The
force from the advanced base began its march at
daylight on April 5.  Baggage and transport were
cut down to the lowest possible limits, and General
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
Byron and I moved ahead of the column in a Ford
van.
</p>

<p>
On the first night we reached the headquarters of
General Thompson, commanding the 14th Division
operating on the Diala.  Next morning, the weather
still promising fair, we were off betimes, and, in spite
of road difficulties, at ten o'clock reached the Motor
Transport Depot at Khaniquin, the last town on
the Turkish side.  After a brief halt to enable us to
swop our somewhat war-worn car for a more efficient
one, we started again, and, within an hour of pulling
up at Khaniquin, had crossed the frontier into
Persia.
</p>

<p>
As we approached the boundary of the crumbling
Ottoman Empire at this point, the road wound round
a low hill.  On an eminence above stood a tumble-down
martello tower which once had held a Turkish
guard; and on a corresponding height on the other
side were the ruins of a Persian fort.  From these
vantage points the two Asiatic Empires, both now
crumbling in decay, had for centuries jealously
watched each other, quarrelling over a mile or two
of disputed territory with all the vehemence of their
Oriental blood.
</p>

<p>
Near Khaniquin, on the Turkish side, we saw what
had once been the Quarantine and Customs Stations.
It was here that the corpse caravans, coming from
the interior of Persia and bound for Kerbela, one of
the holy places of the Shi'ite sect, halted and paid
Customs dues.  It is the pious wish of every Persian
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
to be buried at Kerbela, near the shrine of Hossain
the Martyr.  The town is in the Vilayet of Bagdad,
and in pre-war days the Turks derived a very
handsome revenue from tolls levied on dead Persians
who were being transported to their last resting-place
beside the waters of the Euphrates.  It was a
gruesome but lucrative traffic for the living, whether
Customs officials or muleteers.  These caravans of
dead, by reason of the absence of anything approaching
proper hygienic precautions, probably also carried
with them into Asiatic Turkey a varied assortment
of endemic diseases.  When Persians whose
testamentary dispositions earmarked them for the last
pilgrimage to Kerbela died, they were buried for a
year.  At the end of this period they were exhumed,
enveloped in coarse sacking, lashed two by two on the
back of a mule, and carried to their new resting-place,
accompanied by bands of sorrowing friends and
relatives.
</p>

<p>
We were now well over the frontier, and found
ourselves in a land of desolation and death.  Our
way lay past ruined and deserted villages, many of
the inhabitants of which had been blotted out by
famine.  Beyond a few Persian road guards in
British pay, or an occasional native labour corps
road-making under the protection of a detachment
of Indian Infantry, the country seemed destitute of
life.  On the other side of the frontier I had heard
a good deal as to the appalling economic conditions
of Persia, and of the shortage of food; but now,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
brought face to face with the terrible reality, I
understood for the first time its full significance.
</p>

<p>
Men and women, shrivelled and huddled heaps of
stricken humanity, lay dead in the public ways,
their stiffened fingers still clutching a bunch of grass
plucked from the roadside, or a few roots torn up
from the fields with which they had sought to lessen
the tortures of death from starvation.  At other
times a gaunt, haggard figure, bearing some
resemblance to a human being, would crawl on all
fours across the roadway in front of the approaching
car, and with signs rather than speech plead for a
crust of bread.  Hard indeed would be the heart that
could refuse such an appeal!  So overboard went
our ration supply of army biscuit, bit by bit, on this
our first day in the hungry land of the Shah!
</p>

<p>
At Kasr-i-Shirin, where we made a short halt, we
were soon surrounded by a starving multitude asking
for food.  One poor woman with a baby in her arms
begged us to save her child.  We gave her half a
tin of potted meat and some biscuits, for which she
called down the blessing of Allah on our heads.  Her
maternal solicitude was touching, for, although it
was evident that she was suffering from extreme
hunger, no food passed her lips until her baby had
been supplied.
</p>

<p>
The western slopes of Kasr-i-Shirin are covered
with the remains of a great city.  The outline of
extensive walls can be traced amidst the debris of
masonry.  Masses of roughly hewn sandstone strew
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
the ground.  Within the ancient enclosure are heaps
of tumble-down masonry, all that exists of the houses
that formerly stood there.  Some little distance away
are traceable the ruined outlines of a splendid palace
with spacious underground apartments and beautiful
archways, once the residence of some Acharmenian
or Sasanian monarch.  The remains of a rock-hewn
aqueduct, with reservoir, troughs, and stone pipes,
which brought water to this city of antiquity from
a distance of twelve miles, are still to be seen.
</p>

<p>
From Kasr-i-Shirin onwards there was a gradual
descent to the bottom of the Pai Tak Pass.  It is three
miles to the top of the Pass, and there is a difference
in altitude of about fifteen hundred feet.  Whatever
else they may be, Persians are not roadmakers.
Formerly the only way to scale Pai Tak was by
following a mule track which wound round the
sparsely wooded slopes of the hill.  But now British
military engineers had done some useful spade work
there; an excellent road had been built with easy
gradients, and Pai Tak was negotiable for Ford cars,
and even for heavily laden Peerless lorries.
</p>

<p>
The view from the top was superb.  On either
side of the plateau towered snow-capped mountains.
We found in possession, under Colonel Mathews, a
British force consisting of the 14th Hants.  The
Colonel himself was absent; but the officers of the
battalion gave us a hearty welcome, and fixed us up
with quarters for the night.
</p>

<p>
The Senjabi tribesmen round about were troublesome,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
and their leader, Ali Akhbar Khan, incited by
German propagandists, seemed bent upon coming
into collision with the British.  It was bitterly cold
at Surkhidizeh on the top of the Pai Tak Pass, and
we enjoyed the warmth and comfort of the Hants'
mess quarters.
</p>

<p>
This was an underground circular apartment, cut
out of the earth, into which you descended by a
flight of wooden steps.  The top was roofed with
canvas, tent fashion.
</p>

<p>
Rifle thieves were active in the camp at
Surkhidizeh.  Wandering Kurdish tribesmen showed
special daring in this form of enterprise.  Scarcely
a night passed without the Hants' Camp being raided
for arms.  British rifles brought enormous prices
when sold to the Senjabi and other of the lawless
nomads whose happy hunting-ground is the "No
Man's Land" in the neighbourhood of the
Turko-Persian frontier.  Here a man was socially valued
solely by the arms he carried.  He might be in rags
as far as raiment was concerned, but the possession
of a .303 Lee Enfield, or a German Mauser, marked
him as a man of some distinction and importance in
the country, one who might be expected to do big
things, and with whom it was well to be on friendly
terms.
</p>

<p>
The average nomad whom I came across is not
renowned for physical courage, and in daylight he
will think twice before attacking even a single British
soldier; yet these selfsame tribesmen would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
unhesitatingly raid a British bivouac nightly, and face
the possibility of death, in order to pilfer a couple of
rifles.  Rifle raiding possessed for them a kind of
fascination.  The raiders often failed and paid the
penalty with their lives, but the attempts were never
abandoned for long.  One method was for a brace
of snipers to fire on the sentry and on the guard, so
creating a diversion.  A couple of their fellows, with
their bodies well oiled, naked save for a loin-cloth,
and carrying each a long knife, would meanwhile
crawl into the camp at a place remote from the
point of disturbance, and snatch a rifle or two from
beside the sleeping soldiers.  If caught, they used
their knives, and invariably with fatal effect.  Even
if detected the raiders usually got away, for in the
darkness and confusion it was difficult to fire upon
them without incurring the risk of hitting one of your
own people.
</p>

<p>
I was aroused from a sound sleep the first night
at Surkhidizeh by the noise of rifle firing, followed
by an infernal hullabaloo.  Unbuttoning the tent flap,
and rushing into the open, I found that the rifle
snatchers had been busy again.  A native had
wriggled through the barbed-wire enclosure and, with
the silence of a Red Indian, had entered a tent
occupied by men of the Hants battalion.  The
soldiers slept with the sling of the rifle attached to the
waistbelt.  Cutting through this without disturbing
the owner, the thief had bolted with the weapon.
</p>

<p>
On leaving, he fell over some of the sleeping
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
occupants, who were aroused and sought to grab him,
but in the darkness and confined space of the
bell-tent, they missed the thief and grasped each other's
throats.  The sentry fired, but failed of his mark.
The remainder of the guard and some Indian units
also loosed off a few rounds, but without success.
</p>

<p>
The night favoured the enterprise.  It was pitch
dark.  The raider's friends, from the cover of some
dead ground in the neighbourhood, sniped the camp
intermittently for the next hour or two, until
everybody grew exasperated, and wished that Persia with
its marauding bands, and the whole Middle East
Question were sunk in the deep sea.

CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
THROUGH MUD TO KIRIND
</h3>

<p class="intro">
A city of starving cave-dwellers&mdash;An American woman's mission
to the wild&mdash;A sect of salamanders&mdash;Profiteering among the
Persians&mdash;A callous nation&mdash;Wireless orders to sit
tight&mdash;Awaiting attack&mdash;The "mountain tiger."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Next day we set out for Kirind, about fifteen miles
from Surkhidizeh, where a platoon of the Hants held
an advanced post.  After passing Sar Mil and its
ruined fort, we dipped down into a valley bordered
by high hills, where grew dwarf oaks, with a
background of mountains whose snow-topped peaks
glistened in the warm spring sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Our way lay over a black cotton-soil plain, and
the road looked as if it had recently been furrowed
by a giant plough.  It was hard going for the Ford
cars, and our difficulties were increased when rain
presently overtook us.  Half an hour's downpour
will convert any Persian road into a morass, and
that between Surkhidizeh and Kirind is no exception
to the rule.  The Fords for once were baffled.  The
leading car could get no grip on the slippery soil; its
front wheels revolved aimlessly, then by a mighty
exertion moved forward a few yards, only to come
to an abrupt stop, up to its front axle in a slimy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
mud-hole.  We temporarily jettisoned everything,
and pulled it out with a tow rope and the united
efforts of a dozen friendly natives who were not
averse from a little physical labour for a pecuniary
reward.  There was no getting rid of the glutinous
mud.  It adhered to one's boots and clung to one's
garments with a persistency that was irritating and
ruinous to the temper.  The fifteen miles' journey
occupied four hours, and we were "bogged" seven
times before the cars finally got clear and gained
the roughly paved causeway which, skirting Kirind
village, led to the British military post.
</p>

<br />
TYPICAL PERSIAN VILLAGE.
</p>

<p>
Kirind itself is a straggling and typical group of
Persian mud-houses.  It clings haphazardly to both
sides of a steep, narrow gorge, closed at one end by
a perpendicular wall of jagged limestone rock, which
rises sheer for a thousand feet.  Beneath this
frowning rock-barrier nestles a village abominably and
indescribably filthy, inhabitated by an elf-like people
in whom months of semi-starvation had bred something
of the sullen ferocity of a pack of famishing
wolves.  There was in their eyes the glint of the
hunted wild animal.  They fled at our approach&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;diving into dark, noisome,
underground dens which exhaled a horrible effluvium,
or else bolting like so many scared wild-cats for some
lair high up amongst the limestone ridges.  Some of
the fugitives whom we rounded up and spoke to
compassionately answered with a terrified snarl, as
if dreading we should do them injury.  Yet it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
was chiefly the Turk, that zealous propagandist of
the tenets of Islam, whose rapacity and cruelty had
driven this fellow Moslem race to the borderland of
primitive savagery.
</p>

<p>
Amid all the horror and misery of this desert of
human despair we found a Christian angel of pity,
isolated, working single-handed, striving to alleviate
the terrible lot of the starving people.  The angel
was an American woman, Miss Cowden, of the
Presbyterian Mission.  Years before she had given
up home, country, and friends in obedience to a
higher call, and was devoting her life and her energies
to the betterment of the temporal lot of the unhappy,
underfed, Persian children.  She had learned their
language, and moved from village to village alone
and unattended, carrying out her great work of
charity, and content to live in some dirty hovel.
A vocation surely demanding sublime self-abnegation,
and calling, I should think, for the highest attributes
of faith and courage!  I hold no brief for foreign
missionaries in general.  I know that their
proselytizing methods have been the subject of severe
criticism in the public press and on the lecture
platform.  All the more reason, therefore, why I should
tell of a work which is being done so unobtrusively,
without hope of earthly recompense, and well beyond
the range of the most powerful "Big Bertha" of the
cinema world.
</p>

<p>
The Kirindis for the most part belong to the
curious religious sect called Aliullahis, about
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
whose beliefs and rites many strange legends
circulate.
</p>

<p>
One of these concerns their immunity from injury
by fire, and recalls the "fire walkers" of the Tongan
Islands.  Aliullahian devotees, it is said, will enter
a kind of oven and stay there while fire is heaped
around it, making it red-hot.  Then, covering their
heads with the burning cinders, they cry, "I am cold,"
and pass out unhurt.  Another ceremony consists in
lifting bars of red-hot iron out of the fire with their
bare hands, their skin showing no signs of burning.
</p>

<p>
Their religion seems to be a strange mixture of
Mohammedanism and Judaism, with doctrines from
various other esoteric faiths grafted on to it.  Thus
they number amongst their prophets Benjamin,
Moses, Elia, David, and Jesus Christ, and they have
also a saint of peculiar efficacy in intercession named
Ali.  Some investigators into their creed maintain
that Ali and Daoud (David) are one and the same
person; others think that Ali is so high up in the
spiritual hierarchy as only to be invoked through
Daoud.  In any case, their prayer before battle is,
"O Daoud, we are going to war.  Grant that we
overcome our enemy!"  They then sacrifice some
animal, usually a sheep, which is roasted whole.  The
High Priest prays over the carcass and distributes
the flesh in small portions to those present.
Communion in this sacrament appears to inspire the
Aliullahian with absolute confidence in the success of
any undertaking it precedes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
</p>

<p>
Another of their beliefs is that of a successive
incarnation of the Deity in the greatest of their
spiritual guides, seven of whom are clubbed together
under the name of "Haft-Tan."
</p>

<p>
When in Mohammedan cities, they outwardly
conform to the tenets taught by the Prophet of the
Crescent, but secretly they continue the practice of
their own mystic rites.  They bury their dead
without prayer (after keeping the unembalmed corpse
six days), but turn his head to face Kerbela, as do
the Mussulmans.
</p>

<p>
They are recognizable from their long moustaches,
since the Shiahs are not allowed to have hair so long
as to pass the upper lip.
</p>

<p>
Some authorities proclaim them the remnant of the
Samaritans who, as related in 2 Kings xvii. 6 and 7,
were carried into captivity by Hoshea, King of
Assyria; and Rawlinson, in his writings on Persia,
speaks of a rock-tomb which they regard as a place
of special sanctity.  They call it, he says, Dukka-ni-Daoud
(David's shop), because they believe that the
Jewish monarch was a smith by trade.
</p>

<p>
We stayed two nights in Kirind village.  Our
quarters were a couple of rooms above a stable which
sheltered a sundry collection of goats, sheep, two
consumptive donkeys and their charvadars, some
stray hens, and two or three pariah dogs.  Crossing
a dirty courtyard, where filth had accumulated for
years, we climbed a broken stairway, and were at
home.  The flat roof of the stable was our promenade;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
but, since it was full of holes, which were generally
concealed by a thin layer of sun-dried mud, great
caution was needed to prevent a sudden and
undignified descent into the menagerie below.  Our
rooms opened on to the roof of the stable.  We slept
on the floor, and, as it was cold, our Persian servant
bought some green wood and made a fire in the only
fireplace available, which consisted of a small cavity
in the mud floor.  A hole in the upper roof supplied
ventilation, and served the purposes of a chimney.
</p>

<p>
It was here that the Governor paid an official call
upon General Byron.  He sent a servant to announce
his coming, and presently arrived accompanied by
a retinue of unkempt, hungry-looking officials, all
wearing the chocolate-coloured sugar-loaf hat peculiar
to Persians.  The Governor himself was a fat,
pompous individual, with a drooping moustache,
unshaven face, and no collar.  We wondered at first
whether the stubble on his chin was due to slothfulness,
or was a sign of mourning.  We discovered it
was the latter, a brother of his having died recently
through over-participation in food at some local
festivity.  To look at the portly form of the Governor
made it quite evident that everybody was not going
hungry in Kirind.  As he sat cross-legged on the
floor, his fingers interlaced in front of his breast, and
twirling his thumbs, he looked exactly what he was&mdash;the
personification of hopeless incapacity and
lethargy.  "What ashes are fallen on my head!" he
moaned aloud, by way of expressing sorrow for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
death of so many of the villagers from starvation.
Yet he himself had done nothing to lessen the ravages
of famine in the district, and was content to see the
wretched inhabitants die, without moving a finger to
help them.
</p>

<p>
His attitude was typical of officialdom throughout
this starving land.  The Governor was a landowner,
and probably, like others of his class whom I came
across later in Kermanshah and Hamadan, had
plenty of grain hidden away waiting for the day when
the British Commissariat, in order to feed starving
Persians, would come and buy it at inflated prices,
thus enriching a gang of hoarding, avaricious
rascals.
</p>

<p>
When General Byron spoke of what the British
were doing elsewhere in the way of feeding the
famine-stricken, the Governor's eyes brightened, and scenting
the possibility of an advantageous commercial deal
in cornered wheat, he replied with a fervent
"Mash-allah!" (Praise be to God!)  The suggestion that
thieving local bakers who had been profiteering at
the expense of the starving population might be
taught a salutary lesson by having their ears nailed
to their bakehouse doors, or otherwise dealt with
under some equally benign Persian enactment, seemed
to find favour in the eyes of the Governor, for he
answered, "Inshallah!" (Please God!)
</p>

<p>
This Governor, who had so suddenly developed a
keen interest in the local food problem, was afterwards
present at a full-dress parade of Miss Cowden's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
starvelings.  The recipients of mission charity were
of both sexes, and varied from toddlers of three to
their elders of ten or twelve years.  All they had
in the way of clothing was a piece of discoloured rag,
or a section of a tattered gunny bag, fastened round
the loins.  Physical suffering long endured was
indelibly stamped on their shrunken features and
on their emaciated frames.  Each was given a
substantial chunk of freshly baked chipattee, or
unleavened bread, and they were desired to eat it then
and there to prevent its being pilfered from their
feeble hands by hungry adult prowlers outside the
mission buildings.  They made no demur, and ate
ravenously.  Bread is the staple diet, and generally
the only article of food, of the Persian poor; and this
daily free distribution must have been the means of
preserving the lives of many hundreds of Kirind
children.  Charity in the Anglo-Saxon meaning of
the word seems to find no home in the breast of
the average Persian; and each day there was a fight
between local cupidity, as represented by the Kirind
bakers, and foreign generosity as exemplified by the
American Mission, which was spending its funds freely
in order that these unhappy children of an alien
race might have bread and live.  Here, as elsewhere
during my wanderings through Iran, I was painfully
impressed by the appalling callousness and
indifference exhibited by the ordinary Persian towards
the sufferings of his own people.  He would not lift
a hand to help a dying man, and dead, would leave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
him to the tender mercies of the dogs and vultures
rather than trouble to give him burial.
</p>

<p>
One morning, while preparing for a further move
eastward towards Kermanshah, a wireless message,
transmitted in haste from Surkhidizeh, ordered us to
sit tight and await developments and reinforcements.
We were warned that the Senjabis were restless, and
might any night swoop down on our slenderly-garrisoned
post.  Ali Akhbar Khan, who was the
Pendragon of the Senjabis and various stray allied
bands of nomadic robbers in these parts, was said
to be watching us from his eyrie up in the
snow-capped hills.  His martial ardour had been
stimulated to the verge of action by German gold and
German rifles, and the promise of much loot when
our weak force had been duly annihilated.  To the
careful, calculating Akhbar, and to the wild tribesmen
who had flocked to his standard at the very first
mention of the word "unlimited loot," the capture
of the Kirind post must have seemed the softest
of soft things.  To look our way and resist temptation
was like flying in the face of Providence.  How
that dear old bandit's mouth must have watered in
anticipation of securing a fine haul of rifles,
ammunition, and transport animals!
</p>

<p>
All that stood between Akhbar Khan and the
realization of his project was a platoon of the
14th Hants under Lieutenant Gow, a Lewis gun, a
dozen Persian irregulars of doubtful fighting quality,
and a very unformidable barrier of two rows of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
barbed wire.  The camp was on the edge of a narrow
plateau facing the road.  In the rear, where this
latter became merged in the hills, the smooth slope
was like a toboggan run, and the alert Senjabis, if
they so wished, might have slid from their hill-top
sangars down on to the field of battle.  But they
held aloof; their day was not yet.
</p>

<p>
We spent an anxious night.  Everybody was under
arms waiting for the threatened attack.  Morning
ended our period of suspense and brought the looked-for
reinforcements&mdash;a squadron of the 14th Hussars
under Captain Pope, a couple of guns, an additional
platoon of the Hants, as well as the Dunsterville
contingent which had originally set out from Baqubah.
</p>

<p>
The "mountain tiger," as Ali Akhbar Khan was
called in the imaginative and picturesque vocabulary
of the district, had hesitated, and missed his chance.
The reinforcing party was very much disappointed
at Akhbar's display of irresolution and his reluctance
to fight.  Some amongst the bolder spirits
contemplated calling upon him in his mountain lair.  But
that was not to be.  When the "tiger" did spring
later on, and sought to cut up a British column, he
received the lesson of his life.  But our party was
not there to share in the glory of his undoing.

CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
KIRIND TO KARMANSHAH
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Pillage and famine&mdash;A land of mud&mdash;The Chikar Zabar
Pass&mdash;Wandering dervishes&mdash;Poor hotel accommodation&mdash;A "Hunger
Battalion"&mdash;A city of the past.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
From Kirind to Kermanshah, our next stage, is
about sixty miles.  For the most part it is dreary,
barren country, with a few isolated villages astride
the line of march.  The whole land had been skinned
bare of supplies by Turk and Russian, and it was now
in the throes of famine.
</p>

<p>
There was a good deal of similarity in the methods
of these successive invaders.  They commandeered
unscrupulously and without payment, and what they
could not consume or carry off they destroyed.  There
was no seed wheat, and consequently no crops had
been sown.  Many tillers of the soil had fled for their
lives; those who had remained were dying of hunger
in this war-ravaged region.  The arable land which
is noted for its fertility was forlorn and neglected;
no plough had touched its soil since the passing of
the war storm, and its abandoned furrows were
temporarily tenanted by wandering crows struggling
to gain a precarious livelihood.  It was desolation
and ruin everywhere.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
</p>

<p>
This was the country into which we, too, now, in
our turn adventured.  Armed robbers roamed from
hill to plain and back again, holding up and looting
passing caravans, preying upon the miserable
inhabitants in the remote villages, and relieving them
of anything in the nature of food and live-stock that
the greedy maw of Turk and Russian had
inadvertently overlooked.
</p>

<p>
Little wonder that the terrified wayside inhabitants
fled pell-mell at the approach of our column!  It
took some persuasion to assure them that they would
not be "bled" afresh, nor put to the sword.  Not
unnaturally, they had reason to dread the exactions
of a third invader, and both effort and time were
needed to convince them that our intentions were
not hostile, but friendly.  When confidence was at
last restored, the glad tidings of our exemplary
behaviour sped ahead of us from village to village,
carried by that mysterious agency which in the East
lends wings to any news of import, and in speed
rivals wireless telegraphy.
</p>

<p>
So it was that on our further progress ragged and
cringing peasants, all semblance of manhood driven
out of them by hunger and oppression, would crawl
forth into the light of day from some dark hovel to
beg, firstly for their lives, and secondly for a morsel
of bread.  We granted the one without question,
but were not always able to comply with the second
demand.
</p>

<p>
From Kirind our progress was slow.  The first day,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
Sunday, April 14th, we barely covered ten miles,
arriving at Khorosabad late in the afternoon, where
we bivouacked under the lee of the hills.  The road
beyond was a kind of hog's back strewn with
limestone boulders which proved too difficult for the
laden Ford cars.  To add to our troubles the weather
broke in the evening, and it rained steadily throughout
the night, so that our camping-ground became
a swamp.  The Hussars' horses suffered from
exposure, while the men themselves were wet through
and inclined to be grumpy.  In the morning, as the
weather showed signs of mending, the march was
resumed; but the Ford convoy had to be left behind
in charge of an escort to wait until the road became
passable.
</p>

<p>
The infantry units marched through twelve miles
of mud to Harunabad, the next stage on the journey.
It tried the men's endurance to the utmost.  The
road was simply an unmetalled track across the
plain; there was no foothold in the saturated soil,
and at each step a pound or two of clay adhered to
one's boots, necessitating frequent halts to scrape
them clean.  The Persian muleteers were more
fortunate.  They marched barefoot, and their
movements were not handicapped by the encumbering
dead weight of adhesive earth.

</p>

<p>
Harunabad does not differ essentially from any
other village in South-Western Persia.  Dirt and
decay have laid their twin grip upon its crooked
streets, its tottering mud walls, and ruinous habitations.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
The inhabitants were as hungry as any other
of their class in Persia, and they crowded round the
bivouac cookhouses snatching eagerly at any morsel
of food that was thrown to them.  General Byron,
Captain Eve, Lieutenant Akhbar, and I lighted on
a couple of rooms in a disused caravanserai, and the
local governor, who seemed to bother less about
backsheesh than the average of his fellows, procured
us some mutton and firewood.  Two of his servitors
who had brought the supplies were demanding an
exorbitant price&mdash;the middleman's profit.  The
Governor, happening to arrive on the scene while the
haggling was proceeding, beat the grasping pair
soundly in our presence, and promised them a dose
of the bastinado on the morrow.  Thoroughly abashed
by their drubbing, and terrified by the prospect of
a fresh one next day, they fell upon their knees,
begging for mercy and forgiveness.  The General
successfully pleaded on their behalf, and they showed
their gratitude by kissing his hands, before taking
themselves out of range of the still wrathful eye of
the Governor.
</p>

<p>
The night was cold, with a tinge of frost in the
air.  We sat round the fire after supper drying our
sodden garments and removing the encrustations of
Persian mud which had settled thickly upon them.
Sleep came to us easily after the fatigues of the day,
and it was with a feeling of deep personal resentment
that we heard the Hussars' trumpeter sound
the reveille.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
</p>

<p>
Most transport mules are longsuffering animals,
but they rebel occasionally.  The Persian variety
was inclined to be peevish, when it came to early
rising and taking afresh upon its sturdy back the
burden of the day.  Those of our supply convoy,
when prodded into activity before sunrise, rarely
failed to make their displeasure felt by a vigorous
protest lodged at random in some part of a charvadar's
anatomy.  On the morning of our departure
from Harunabad the mules showed themselves
especially intractable.  It could hardly have been
because of any deep-rooted affection for the locality
itself.  However, at the cost of much profanity and
shouting on the part of the muleteers, during which
grave aspersions were cast upon the character of
the mules' ancestors, the rebellious beasts were
cowed into submissiveness and our column was
soon floundering anew in the mud of the Persian
wilderness.
</p>

<p>
A wind from the north blew across our path and
sent the menacing rain-clouds scurrying to the
right-about.  The sun, too, unveiled its face, as if
half-ashamed of its tardiness, and speedily dispelled the
curtain of white mist which arose from the sodden
earth.  The air was keen and invigorating, but
tempered by the warm breath of spring.  Men and
horses and transport mules responded to the
gladsome call of Nature in her most beneficent mood.
British soldier and Persian charvadar each sang the
wild songs of his native land, telling invariably of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
some fair, beauteous maiden whom the sentimental
songster had left behind somewhere in England or
Iran.  To the ears of one riding on in advance, as
I happened to be that day, this flow of song blending
with the deep note of the jingling mule-bells made
sweetest music.
</p>

<p>
Four hours' march brought the head of the column
to the top of the Chihar Zabar Pass.  The road went
sheer down the reverse slope, cutting across an
immense plain carpeted with the deepest emerald
green.  Here wild flowers grew in abundance&mdash;crocuses,
daffodils, daisies, violets, and a species of
indigenous primrose, a woof of rich, glorious
colouring in the warp of green.  This "Promised Land,"
the work of Nature's own brush, stretched away
from my very feet till it mingled with the grey-blue
of the distant horizon.  What a pleasing contrast
to the dreary, desolate lowlands we had so lately
traversed!  It was a most welcome prospect to eyes
tired of looking upon dull, monotonous landscapes.
To me it was the fairest sight I had yet seen in the
land of Iran.
</p>

<p>
While I was revelling in the beauty of the scene,
there appeared on the summit of the Pass, coming
from this valley of enchantment, three men whose
dress and appearance excited my curiosity.  They
were sturdily built, and dressed in black, skirted coats,
fastened at the waist by a girdle from which was
suspended a sword and satchel.  Their beards were
no longer than that permitted by the precepts of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
the Koran.  They were without head-covering of
any kind, and their long hair fell free and untrammelled
on their shoulders.  The trio wore shoes of
Moroccan leather with pointed, turned-up toes and
silver buckles.  Each carried a small silver-headed
axe at the "slope," as a cavalry trooper does a
sabre.
</p>

<p>
As they approached, my first feeling was one of
alarm, and my hand instinctively sought my revolver
holster.  Seeing this, the foremost raised his hand
in friendly salutation, and greeted me with, "Peace
be upon thee, O stranger!"  They proved to be
wandering dervishes who begged their way from end
to end of Persia, and to judge by their raiment and
their general well-to-do appearance, it must be a
profitable occupation.
</p>

<p>
These dervishes, amongst the Persians of all
classes, have a great reputation for sanctity.  The
rich help them liberally, and even the very poor will
not turn a deaf ear to their request for aid.  One of
them chattered away like a magpie, recounting
adventures which were not always of the kind one
is prone to associate with the austerity of a Religious
Order.  They had come on foot from Meshed in
Eastern Persia to Teheran, Hamadan, and
Kermanshah, and were now bound for Kerbela and the
Shi'ite holy places in the vicinity of Bagdad.  The
burdens of life sat lightly on their shoulders, and the
destroying hand of care had left no traces upon their
merry, laughing faces.  They were a cheery trio,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
forgetful of yesterday, unmindful of to-morrow, and
living only for to-day.
</p>

<p>
They were full of a pleasant inquisitiveness, and
withal as simple as children.  "Were there dervishes
across the big water in Faringistan (Europe), and
had the man-birds (aviators) come to Bagdad?"
they asked.  I told them they would see plenty of
"man-birds" and "wonder-houses" (cinemas) down
yonder in Bagdad, but that an itinerant Persian
dervish would be a <i>rara avis</i> amongst our benighted
folk, not one, so far as I knew, having yet shed the
light of his countenance upon our slow-going old
Western world.  With a small cash contribution oh
my part towards the expenses of their journey, and
on theirs the formal invocation of the blessing of
Allah upon my head, the dervishes and I exchanged
cordial adieux, and parted company on the summit
of the Chihar Zabar.
</p>

<p>
Our next halting-place was at Mahidast, a walled
town which stands in the midst of an immense plain
seventy miles long by ten broad.  It is one of the
most fertile tracts in Persia, and grows great crops
of wheat and barley for the market of Kermanshah.
As for Mahidast itself, it consists of a few dirty
streets, unpaved and evil-smelling, and a hundred
houses, the greater number of which are in ruins.
Its inhabitants are chiefly Kalhur-Kurds, semi-nomads,
who migrate in winter with their flocks to
the neighbourhood of Khaniquin and Mandali.
Mahidast is a great resort of pilgrims on the way
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
to and from Kerbela, and in the main street stands
a vast caravanserai built by that industrious
architect-ruler, Shah Abbas.
</p>

<p>
I rode inside the great doorway of Shah Abbas'
hostelry hoping to find quarters here, but my nose
was in revolt at once.  A stagnant pool covered with
green slime, where myriads of mosquitoes and flies
were undergoing a course of field training, occupied
the centre of the courtyard, and this was flanked by
festering heaps of garbage amongst which lean,
hungry-looking dogs were fossicking for an evening meal.
</p>

<p>
Turning in disgust from the loathsome spot, I
encountered a farrash (messenger) come from the
Naib-ul-Hukumeh, or Deputy Governor, The latter
had heard of our arrival, and sent to conduct us to
quarters near his own dwelling.  Our abode proved
to be a smaller caravanserai, its living-rooms
adjoining the stables and looking out on a manure heap.
The Deputy Governor himself turned up presently,
and in the usual flowery Persian speech bade General
Byron welcome, and assured him that supplies of
forage and fuel would be forthcoming.
</p>

<p>
He hinted that, as the prowling Kurds of the
district were keen horse-fanciers, and not always able
to discriminate between the niceties of <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum</i>, it would be advisable to mount a stable guard.
For this purpose he sent us eight truculent-looking
rascals, fairly bristling with weapons, who watched
over our horses while we sought to snatch a few
hours' repose.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
</p>

<p>
Sleep we found to be out of the question.  Our
sleeping-bags, the latest of their kind from London,
had no chance against the incursions of the nimble
Mahidast flea, or his bigger parasitical brethren,
whom pilgrim caravans had brought from the remote
corners of Persia.  Emerging angry and unrefreshed
from an unequal combat, we quitted Mahidast at an
early hour.  The major portion of the inhabitants
were present to see us off, and incidentally to demand
a pishkash for services&mdash;chiefly imaginary&mdash;rendered
us during our sojourn.  Akhbar paid off the fuel and
forage vendors, and ransomed our horses from the
stable guard for a substantial sum in krans.  He next
gave a considered decision in respect to the claim of
the Deputy Governor and his numerous retinue.
The former modestly demanded an amount which
would have provided him with a comfortable life
annuity, pointing out that, as our throats were
unsevered and our purses untouched, we could afford
to be generous, and reward his protecting zeal.  I
did not wait for the end of the negotiations, but I
heard afterwards that Akhbar, whose temper had
been sorely tried, consigned the Deputy Governor to
<i>jahannam</i>, and effected a compromise with his
insistent retainers for the equivalent of ten shillings.
</p>

<p>
It is an eighteen-mile march to Kermanshah from
Mahidast.  The road was harder, and it was easier
travelling for the horses and transport animals.
There was a good deal of traffic too.  We passed
numerous caravans, the first being one of tobacco
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
and general merchandise bound for Bagdad.  To
this a number of pilgrims had attached themselves
for safety, and had hired an armed convoy to protect
them against plundering Kurds and, in a minor
sense, the exactions of the Persian road guards.
These latter were supposed to police the route, and
had posts along the road.  By way of recompense
they were allowed to levy baj (toll) upon travellers.
But their rapacity was boundless.  They were said
to stand in with the freebooters of the district, and
woe betide the simple traveller or merchant who,
journeying without armed retainers, fell into their
hands!  Him they fleeced unmercifully, and if the
victim were inclined to protest against this bare-faced
spoliation, he might always be sure of receiving
a sound beating in addition.
</p>

<p>
So much for Persian road guards and their methods!
The British sought to remedy these abuses by subsidizing
local chiefs to protect a section of road, but
the chiefs took the cash and stuck to it, while the
guards still dipped deeply into the pockets or into
the bales of merchandise of those who came their
way.  It was considered a lucrative post, that of
road guard, and much sought after by gentlemen
who hated the attendant risks of ordinary highway
robbery, and preferred the easier and surer means of
growing rich by levying toll in a quasi-official capacity.
</p>

<p>
Presently we met a corpse-caravan bound for
Kerbela with its lugubrious freight.  A contingent
of road guards had gathered round like so many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
human vultures, and there was much haggling
between themselves and angry relatives of the defunct
as to what a dead Persian ought or ought not to
pay to pass free and unhindered over this section of
the long and thorny road that led to the holy of
holies of the Shi'ite Moslem.
</p>

<p>
On the banks of a stream by the roadside was a
"hunger battalion" resting.  Its members, men
and boys, were in a state of semi-nudity; their few
garments hung in tattered rags about their wasted
bodies, and all looked to be in the last stage of
physical exhaustion from starvation.  For some the
end had clearly come.  They were incapable of
further effort, and lay waiting for a merciful death to
cut short their sufferings.  Others there were who
still clung despairingly to the enfeebled thread of
life.  They crouched on the ground, gnawing frantically
at a handful of roots or coarse herbs with which
they sought to assuage the terrible pangs of
unsatisfied hunger.  A little apart from the main body
was a small group crooning a mournful dirge: it was
the funeral requiem of a man whom famine had
killed.  The body was being prepared for burial and,
before committal to earth, was being washed in the
stream which supplied a near-by village with drinking
water.
</p>

<p>
We divided some food amongst the sorely stricken
survivors of the hunger battalion.  It was all we
could give.  They were thankful, and one man said
that he and five companions had originally started
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
from Hamadan, where the people were dying by
hundreds daily, in the hope of crossing the frontier
to Khaniquin or Kizil Robat, at either of which places
they might get work and food in the British Labour
Corps.  Of the six who had set out on this quest he
was the sole survivor.
</p>

<p>
Kermanshah is a very old Persian city, and was
known to writers and travellers from the earliest
Christian times.  It once was a flourishing industrial
and commercial centre, but much of its prosperity
and glory have been dimmed by a succession of
political and economic vicissitudes.  The town itself
has a certain military importance.  It is close to the
Turkish frontier, and is equidistant from Bagdad,
Ispahan, Teheran, and Tabriz.  During the War Turks
and Russians occupied it in turn, and the Turks had
a consul and a consular guard here until their army
was chased out of the province.
</p>

<p>
Outside the town itself the nomadic and
semi-nomadic population consists chiefly of Kurds, and
Kurdi is the language of the people as distinct from
the merchants.  Cereals are extensively grown, but,
owing to the lack of communications, the cost of
transporting grain to Bagdad or Teheran was triple
its local market value, and it was a profitless
enterprise.  The grain rotted in Kermanshah while people
died of hunger in adjoining provinces.
</p>

<p>
The chief trade route in Western Persia passes
through Kermanshah, and it is also an important
market for transport mules, which are bred in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
district.  In pre-war days as many as 200,000
pilgrims passed through Kermanshah each year on
their way to and from Kerbela and the other Shi'ite
shrines in the Vilayet of Bagdad.  The bazaars were
well stocked with British and foreign goods, and the
local traders were reputed to be wealthy.  But the
War and the coming of the Turks were fatal to
Kermanshah and its commerce; the shops were closed,
and the wealthier merchants hid their cash and
valuables and sought asylum elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Kermanshah suffered much during the Civil War
of 1911-12.  In July of 1911 it was occupied in the
name of the ex-Shah, Muhammad Ali, by a force
of irregulars under Salar-ud-Dauleh, the ex-Shah's
brother.  In the following February the Government
troops reoccupied Kermanshah, and the troops of the
dethroned Shah were driven out.  But a fortnight
later Salar-ud-Dauleh, aided by a large force of
Kurds, was back again; the town was plundered, and
the Governor appointed by the Constitutionalists had
his legs cut off and was burnt alive.  For the next
few months the redoubtable Salar and his military
opponent, Farman Farma, hunted each other in turn
up and down Western Persia until the Shah's rebellion
was finally subdued.
</p>

<p>
I found the streets of the town narrow and tortuous.
The Zarrabiha Street and that leading from the
Darvaseh Sarab to the Chal Hassan Khan are about
the only two possible for carriages.  In the Feizabad
quarter, which is remote from the bazaars, are the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
houses of the wealthy classes, with their immense
courtyards, high walls, and beautifully kept gardens.
By contrast, the houses of the poor look despicably
mean, being simply a collection of mud hovels
into which the light of day penetrates with
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
The rain overtook us afresh at Kermanshah, and
we had to stay there for three days weatherbound.
The Hussars and the remainder of the column
bivouacked on a hill near the British Consulate.  It
was far from agreeable.  The tents were already
soaking wet after the downpour at Khorosabad, and
had had no time to dry.
</p>

<p>
General Byron went to stay with the Kennions.
Colonel Kennion was Political Officer and Consul, and
his wife, a very charming and energetic lady, who
held in her hands most of the threads of the political
happenings in Persia, worked hard all day in the
office ciphering and deciphering despatches.  In the
evening she entertained her husband's guests and
graced a hospitable table.
</p>

<p>
The foreign colony of Kermanshah was not a large
one.  Besides the Kennions, there were the Russian
Consul and his wife, a French Consul, Mr. and
Mrs. Stead of the American Presbyterian Mission, and
Mr. Hale, local manager of the Imperial Bank of
Persia.  Hale has travelled widely in Persia, and
knew its elusive and nimble-witted people better
than most Englishmen.  He was an excellent raconteur,
and I spent pleasant evenings in his company
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
laughing over stories of adventure which irresistibly
called to mind that great exponent of Persian drollery,
"Hadji Baba."
</p>

<p>
Leaving our horses behind to be brought on by the
marching column, General Byron and six officers,
including myself, moved by motor convoy from
Kermanshah on April 22nd.  With luck we hoped to
reach Hamadan in two days.
</p>

<p>
It is twenty-two miles to Bisitun Bridge and the
crossing of the Gamasiab, a tributary of the Kara
river.  The brick bridge over the stream had been
destroyed by the retreating Russians.  It had not
yet been repaired, and we were to be faced with the
difficult problem of getting the Ford cars across to
the eastern bank of the Gamasiab.  The recent rains
had done their worst for the road track which led
over the great plain of Kermanshah, and the soil
had been converted into a kind of pulpy clay which
the passage of recent caravans had churned into
puddle.  The laden cars bravely struggled through
it, sinking occasionally to the axles in the treacherous
mire.  Finally, we crawled out of this bog and struck
a patch of hard road which led to the village of
Bisitun, where we halted to allow the other bogged
cars to join up.  Beyond the straggling village of
thirty houses or so the great rock of Bisitun rises
perpendicularly from the level plain.
</p>

<p>
Bisitun is famous for the inscriptions and tablets
of Darius found here.  It lies on the highway from
Ecbatana to Babylon, and was thus chosen by various
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
monarchs as a fitting place for the record of their
exploits.
</p>

<p>
It is to British pluck, tenacity, and will-power that
the world owes its definite and detailed knowledge of
the Darius inscriptions.  That "King of Kings," as
he proudly styles himself, saw to it that the written
account of his greatness should be at a height
corresponding with his fame, and had it placed 300 feet
above the ground on the wall of a dizzily perpendicular
cliff.  To climb this rock near enough to read
what Persian workmen chiselled there five hundred
years before the Christian era is the dangerous and
difficult undertaking accomplished by Rawlinson.
</p>

<p>
The bas-relief tablets and inscriptions on Bisitun's
famous cliff wall have all but one object&mdash;to glorify
Darius Hystaspes ("The great King, the King of
Kings, King of Persia, King of the Provinces"), and
to give the lie to any of his enemies or rivals who
dared to proclaim themselves monarchs also.  ("This
Gaumata the Magian lied: thus did he speak: 'I am
Bardiya; son of Cyrus, I am King!'")
</p>

<p>
Grandiloquently the names of the countries over
which Darius ruled are set forth.  They number
twenty-three.  A Persian Alexander the Great was
this "King of Kings."
</p>

DARIUS INSCRIPTIONS AT BISITUN.
</p>

<p>
The bas-relief vividly portrays his conquest of the
lesser chieftains from whom he wrested their kingdoms.
His foot is on the prostrate form of the most
formidable of these, Gaumata, while the others are
shown tied together by their necks, a sorry company
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
of defeated royalties.  Darius is depicted as physically
towering above the men of his day, a giant in every
way.  Over him hovers the Godhead, Auramazdn,
or Ormuzd, who, holding a circlet of victory in one
hand, with the other points out the mighty monarch
as the wearer-designate.
</p>

<p>
The whole is in a marvellous state of preservation,
thanks to the conscientious work of the craftsmen
who laboured at it so many thousand years ago.
After first smoothing the surface of the rock, they
filled in every tiny crevice or crack with lead.  Then
they chiselled deeply, and with astonishing accuracy,
each character, finally coating the whole with a
silicious varnish, a protection against climatic ravages
which has stood the test imposed upon it while
countless generations of mankind have come and
gone.
</p>

<p>
When we reached the Gamasiab, we found the
stream in flood, and a six-knot current swirling
through the brick arches of the damaged bridge.
There was a great gap in the central span, the latter
running to a point almost like a Gothic arch.  Gangs
of workmen were busy repairing it, under Lieutenant
Goupil, R.E.
</p>

<p>
Captain Goldberg, of the Armoured Car Section, had
preceded us to Bisitun.  Goldberg, who had ripped
roads through East African jungle to get within
shooting distance of the Hun, claimed that in his
service lexicon there was no such word as fail, and
that wherever a transport mule could pass in Persia
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
he would take his lighter cars.  At Bisitun he was as
good as his word.  The animals of the transport were
ferried across on crudely constructed rafts to which
were attached inflated goatskins to give additional
buoyancy.  They were of the type of the Mussik
raft of the Tigris, and the scheme worked successfully.
But it was a tricky business when it came to
ferrying motor-cars over.  Our own Fords were
emptied of their contents, and a single car was lashed
on a raft which was then man-hauled across a hundred
yards of stream to the other bank.  Sometimes one
of the guide-ropes gave way, and the raft and its
burden, caught by the swift current, would go gyrating
down stream until it was lassooed by pursuing coolies
on a second raft.  At other times the wheel-lashings
would part in transit, and the raft would "nose dip"
at a dangerous angle.  Then the Persian labour
coolies, with wild shouts and cries, would jump into
the water and restore the equilibrium of the
water-logged raft by clinging to its stern.  All our cars
were in this manner safely carried over without
serious mishap, and the stores and baggage were
brought on coolies' backs across the wrecked bridge
itself.  On the eastern bank the Fords were reloaded
and the party got under way once more.
</p>

<p>
We spent the night at Kangavar, a big village at
the eastern end of the Bisitun gap, and at the junction
of the Hamadan Qum and Daulatabad roads, fifty-five
miles from Kermanshah.  Kangavar reposes at
the foot of a lofty, snow-capped mountain, and is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
built on a series of natural and artificial mounds
which rise corkscrew fashion from the plain.  Here
are the ruins of a large temple or palace whose history
is lost in antiquity.  That profound scholar and
archæologist, Rawlinson, thinks that Kangavar is the
Chavon of Diodorus, where, according to the Sicilian
historian, Semiramis built a palace and laid out a
paradise.  There also existed at Kangavar a
celebrated temple of Anaitis, whose lascivious cult was
once widespread in this ancient land.
</p>

<p>
We were hospitably entertained by the representative
of the Deputy Governor, who is noted for
his pro-British sympathies.  The Sheikh, our host,
furnished us with quarters within his own residence,
a wonderful walled enclosure big enough to hold a
battalion, and laid out with beautiful gardens and
fountains.  In the trees the laqlaqs (storks) nested,
and down by the cool splashing fountains a peacock
in all the beauty of fully displayed plumage strutted
proudly.
</p>

<p>
We were seven officers to supper, but our host, in
accordance with the lavishness required by Persian
hospitality, prepared enough food for four times our
number.  His multitude of retainers looked on while
we ate, and what remained of the feast passed to
them by right of custom.
</p>

<p>
It was with considerable misgivings that we heard
that the shorter road to Hamadan over the great
Asadabad Pass, nearly eight thousand feet high, was
closed by snow.  We accordingly took the longer
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
and lower road by way of Parisva and Tasbandi
which skirts the Alvand mountain range.  The cars
bogged incessantly in the low, flat country, but
going over the Parisva Pass, where the gradients are
steep and great boulders strew the route, our
progress was also very slow.  The cars had to be
manhandled, being towed and pushed by peasants
collected from the neighbouring fields.  There were
several "lame ducks" in the convoy, and before
evening a number had broken down altogether and
had to be temporarily abandoned by the roadside in
charge of an armed guard.

<p>
Night had already fallen when the leading cars
crawled into Hamadan, having taken fourteen hours
to cover a journey of about ninety-five miles.  Weary
and travel-stained, we reported at British
Headquarters, and to our joy found that everyone was
well, and that the Dunsterville Garrison, overawing
the turbulent section of the population, was still in
possession of this isolated post in the heart of Persia.

CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
A CITY OF FAMINE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
In ancient Hamadan&mdash;With Dunsterville at last&mdash;His precarious
position&mdash;"Patriots" as profiteers&mdash;Victims of famine&mdash;Driven
to cannibalism&mdash;Women kill their children for food&mdash;Trial
and execution&mdash;Famine relief schemes&mdash;Death blow
to the Democrats&mdash;"Stalky."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Hamadan stands at a height of six thousand feet
at the foot of the Alvand range, which is covered
with snow for ten months in the year.  In summer,
when the tender shoots of the growing corn are pushing
above the earth, and the trees are blossom-laden,
"every prospect pleases."  The reverse of the medal
is presented after a brief acquaintance with Hamadan's
people, and one sadly recalls that "only man
is vile."
</p>

<p>
It is said that modern Hamadan occupies the site
of one of the ancient Ecbatanas of the Greeks, of
which there were seven, and that it was the treasure
city of the Achæmenian Kings, the place taken and
plundered by Alexander the Great when he was
"strafing" the Eastern World.  However that may
be, very few ancient remains have been brought to
light.  On a hill outside the town are the ruins of a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
citadel, and a carved stone lion of venerable aspect
and crude workmanship crouches by the roadside
not far from the British Hospital Compound.  This
lion may once have adorned the façade of an
Achæmenian palace, but he has fallen from royal
greatness to plebeian utility; for it is popularly
believed that he exercises a protective influence
against cholera, smallpox, plague, and kindred ills;
and Persian mothers bring their children and seat
them on his stone back to obtain immunity from
disease.  Famine is evidently not included, or so
many children would not have succumbed during the
hunger days of the spring and early summer of 1918,
before that never-failing talisman, the British
Commissariat, exorcised the famine fiend.
</p>

<p>
In Hamadan, too, is buried the celebrated
philosopher and physician of Bokhara, Abu ali ibn Sina,
better known as Avicenna, the legend of whose
fondness for eleventh-century wine and women has come
down through all the ages, obscuring whatever
reputation he may have possessed as a healer or thinker.
</p>

<p>
The Jews of Hamadan, and they are numerous,
point with pride to the site of the tombs of Esther
and Mordecai.  It is very uncertain whether either
of these personages who figure so prominently in the
Book of Esther is buried here.  Within an
insignificant-looking, weather-worn, stucco-covered shrine
in the grip of decay, are two wooden sarcophagi
covered with faded paint and bearing gilt inscriptions
in Hebrew of verses from the Book of Esther.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Rabbi in charge, a sallow-faced man with a
long white beard, who had seen generations of Gentiles
come and go while he kept watch and ward here,
assured me that the tomb of this heroine of the
Jewish race, who stooped to amatory conquest that
her people might live, as well as that of her shrewd
relative, the opportunist Mordecai, were of
unquestionable authenticity.  I will leave it at that.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of our small party in Hamadan at the
beginning of May added a hundred or so additional
rifles to the unwelcome and uninvited skeleton force
already there.  As I related in a previous chapter,
General Dunsterville, after falling back from Resht,
established himself in Hamadan, his available fighting
force being a handful of officers and a baker's dozen
of N.C.O's.  He was in the midst of a more or less
hostile population of about 70,000, one-fourth of
whom were Turks or of Turkish origin and sympathies,
the remainder being Persian, with a small sprinkling
of Jews and Armenians.
</p>

<p>
Yet he sat there unharmed while the Asiatic world
wondered.  His position was precariousness itself.
The full virulence of political animosity was focussed
upon him and his dangerously thin khaki line.  I am
convinced that no Assurance Company, however
speculative, would have considered him a "safe life"
during those dark and doubtful days, when he was
barricaded within the British Compound, alternately
waiting for the inglorious but picturesque death so
fervently promised him by the local Democrats, or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
watching for the reinforcements which dribbled
fitfully from Bagdad and over Persian plain and
mountain.
</p>

<p>
Hamadan was at once the foyer of Turkish
espionage and of Persian intrigue.  The moribund
association of local Democrats, merchants and
grain-growers, had been largely galvanized into
anti-British activity by Kuchik Khan, whose army of
Jungalis still barred the road from Manjil to the
Caspian Sea.  The Hamadan Democrats were "pure
patriots," who talked glibly in the local tea-houses
of the blessing of political freedom, cursed the British
as mischievous, evil-minded interlopers, and called
upon Allah to bless their deliberations and rid them
of the British oppressor.  Incidentally, they would
meet in secret conclave and decree a further increase
in grain prices, which meant a substantial gain to
themselves.  Supplies were refused to the British
except at very exorbitant rates; the profiteers waxed
fat and became more insolent; and the poor of
Hamadan were left to die of hunger, victims of
Persian cupidity and Persian indifference.  Pamphlets,
inflammatory in tone, and bearing the imprimatur of
the principal democratic club, were distributed
broadcast in the streets, and from these the victims
of famine had at all events the ante-mortem
satisfaction of learning that it was the British who were
deliberately starving them to death in order that
these beardless intruders might the more easily
overrun the whole land of Persia.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
</p>

<p>
If a Persian Democrat be valorous in speech, he is
fortunately discreet in deeds.  An ukase would go
forth from Kuchik Khan that there was to be a truce
to temporizing, and that the Dunsterforce must be
sent without delay to the Jehannam of Unbelievers.
"By Allah, it will be accomplished!" would be the
prompt reply.  Then the fearless Democrats, always
careful never to risk their own skins unduly, would
hire some half-starved fedais or irregulars, who for
a kran or two would fire a few shots into British
Headquarters, or, under cover of dusk and a sand-bank,
snipe some solitary officer or soldier of our
force.  Whereat there would be much rejoicing in
democratic circles, and the club would sit up late
drinking arak.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the hunger mortality in Hamadan was
increasing.  Bread, the chief, indeed the only, article
of diet of the poor, was at 14 krans a batman (roughly,
the equivalent of ten shillings for 7 lbs.), and the
wheat combine saw to it that the price increased
rather than decreased.  On May 6th Mr. McDouell,
the British Consul, officially computed that the daily
deaths from starvation were two hundred.  Hamadan
was a city of horrors.  The unburied victims of
famine&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;were lying in
the streets and in the fields adjoining British
Headquarters.  The Kashish or priest of the Shi'ite
mosque, who received a fee of about twopence for
officiating at the funerals of those buried in <i>forma
pauperis</i>, admitted that the daily interment-roll was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
one hundred and sixty during the first fortnight of
May.  The hunger-enfeebled survivors became
herbivorous, eating the grass in the fields like so many
animals.  A short course of this diet proved as fatal
as the want of bread, for it invariably caused
peritonitis and a lingering, agonizing death.
</p>

<p>
But there was worse to come.  The foodless people,
driven crazy by their sufferings, now resorted to
eating human flesh.  Cannibalism was a crime hitherto
unknown in Persia, and no punishment exists for it
under Persian law.  The offenders were chiefly
women, and the victims children stolen from the
doorsteps of their homes, or snatched up haphazard in
the bazaar purlieus.  Mothers of young children
were afraid to leave them while they went to beg for
bread, lest in their absence they should be kidnapped
and eaten.  I never went into the Bazaar or through
the narrow, ill-paved streets without a feeling of
sickly horror at the sight of the human misery revealed
there.  Children who were little better than human
skeletons would crowd round to beg for bread or
the wherewithal to purchase it, and in parting with
a few coppers to them, one could not help shuddering
and wondering if they, too, were destined, sooner or
later, to find their way into the cooking-pot.
</p>

<p>
The Persian Governor one day awoke from his
habitual lethargy and roused the local police, who
set out on the track of the child-eaters.  A series of
domiciliary visits brought to light fragments of
human bones and rags of clothing.  They arrested
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
eight women, who confessed that they had kidnapped,
killed, and eaten a number of children, pleading that
hunger had driven them to these terrible crimes.
</p>

<p>
On the following day, May 8th, a yet more
horrifying case of cannibalism was discovered.  Two
women, mother and daughter, were caught red-handed.
They had killed the daughter's eight-year-old
child, and were cooking the body, when the
police interrupted the preparations for this horrible
feast.  The half-cooked remains were removed in a
basket, and an indignant crowd of well-fed Democrats
followed the wretched offenders to the police-station,
threatening them with death.
</p>

<p>
Some of the people, who did not share the noble
view of the Democrats that the poor should starve
rather than that cornered wheat should be released,
went to the telegraph office with the intention of
informing the weak and incapable Teheran
Government of the true state of affairs.
</p>

<p>
But the Democrats would have none of that; it
might upset their carefully laid schemes for
enrichment at the expense of the flesh and blood of their
fellows.  There was no telling what effect a
telegraphed protest might have upon the supineness of
the Shah's Cabinet Ministers.  Those administrative
sluggards might be goaded into some action bordering
on interference with the policy of the Hamadan
Democrats, which Heaven forbid!  So Democrat
emissaries picketed the Persian telegraph office, and
pitched into the street any of their adversaries who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
questioned their right to impose an arbitrary
censorship.  Thus was made manifest the "benign rule"
of the "friends of Persia" in all its callous disregard
for the first principles of humanity.
</p>

<p>
On the following day there was the sequel to the
case of child murder by mother and daughter, when
these two unfortunates paid the cruel penalty
imposed by Persian law for killing one's own
offspring&mdash;that of being stoned to death.  The "execution"
took place in front of the Hamadan telegraph office.
The condemned women, already on the borderland of
death from hunger, were staked down in two shallow
pits near where heavy stones were plentiful.  Then
the police, reinforced by a willing mob, armed themselves
with heavy boulders and pounded the flickering
life out of their emaciated frames, silencing for
ever their unavailing cries for pity and mercy.  It
was a revolting spectacle, and although their crime
was an abominable one, no one not a Persian could
repress a feeling of compassion for the wretched
creatures who, made desperate by hunger, had become
so dead to all human instinct as to kill and be
prepared to eat their own flesh and blood.
</p>

<p>
Other women were apprehended and executed for
child murder.  It was reported that there was
plenty of wheat stored in private houses, and it was
urged that severe measures should be taken against
the hoarders.  The men were still eating their
evening meal of grass, flavoured with a little salt.  One
of the favourite trysting-places of the Democrat
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
stalwarts was the football-ground near the Hospital
Compound.  Nearly every afternoon in fine weather,
when the ground was not being used for play, they
sat there cross-legged&mdash;in their brown and black
loose-fitting robes, resembling so many clucking hens
on a roost&mdash;discussing and planning the overthrow
of the British, while hundreds of their own people
lay dying around them of starvation.
</p>

<p>
In Hamadan, to add to our other difficulties, we
were greatly troubled with professional mendicants,
whose ages varied from six to sixty, and whose energy
and begging zeal were unbounded.  In time we got
to know them, chiefly, I think, because of their
physical fitness.  They were always in the pink of
condition, sound in wind and limb, and could run a
mile in pursuit of a likely dole without turning a hair,
while their vigorous lung power would have done
credit to a "cheap jack" auctioneer.
</p>

<p>
I always did, and always shall, admire the wonderful
patience and clemency exercised by Dunsterville
when faced with the Democratic organization, which
aimed at nothing short of wiping out both himself
and his force in Hamadan, if not by a <i>tour de force</i>,
then by starvation.  They were always inciting the
populace to rise and finish us.  But hungry men have
little stomach for blood-letting, and although those
in Hamadan found it difficult enough to exist owing
to the food shortage, they were in no hurry to abridge
their unhappy days by flinging themselves on British
bayonets.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Hun or the Turk would have ended this
intolerable situation long ago by decorating Hamadan
lamp-posts with the dangling bodies of local
Democrats; but Dunsterville was forbidden to embark upon
any strong measures.  Our own Minister in Teheran,
Sir Charles Marling, kept warning us that we were
neutrality-breakers, and wondering whether the
Persian Government, even by the exercise of all his
(the Minister's) diplomatic skill, could ever be
induced to forgive us.  Sir Charles, who has since
been transferred to some other sphere of usefulness,
was always quick to grasp and expound the Persian
official point of view.  I often wonder if he ever
busied himself with attempting to understand that
of the British concerning the occupation of Hamadan
and Kasvin.
</p>

<p>
One of the contributory causes of the Hamadan
famine was the insane behaviour of the Russian Army
when in occupation of the town and district.  They
destroyed the growing crops of wheat and barley,
and wantonly wasted the grain they were unable to
consume or carry off.  The Hamadan harvest is not
ripe for gathering until about the first week in July,
so the British, in May, were faced with the problem
of feeding a starving population for some sixty days.
It was not incumbent upon them to do so, but both
pity and policy coincided in indicating the necessity
for combating the evil of food shortage that was so
rapidly thinning out the population.
</p>

<p>
With the approval of the British Government a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
scheme of famine relief was inaugurated by General
Dunsterville.  Labour gangs were formed, and under
the supervision of our officers the starving multitude
was set to work road-making.  In about the first
week three thousand offered themselves for employment,
and were enrolled.  Nominally, only the able-bodied
were supposed to be eligible, but judging by
the human wrecks that one saw in the Labour Corps
few of this category existed in Hamadan.  The
road-makers, at the beginning, were paid four krans per
diem (a kran is, at war-exchange, the equivalent of
a franc), and it was stipulated that they should
provide themselves with a spade or mattock and
a basket in which to carry away the loosened earth.
A number, it is true, did present themselves armed
with the narrow-bladed bilm or spade of the Persian
agricultural labourer, but there were hundreds who
heroically tackled the job equipped with nothing
more efficacious than wooden rice-spoons.  Still, no
one kicked at this, and the rice-spoon wielders did
their "bit," or attempted to do it to the best of
their enfeebled ability.  Our object was rather to
be content with some colourable imitation of a <i>quid
pro quo</i> for cash disbursements, than to exact a stiff
day's labour from people wholly incapable of
performing it.
</p>

<p>
In our blissful ignorance of Persian psychology,
we fondly imagined at first that the equivalent of
£400 a day paid out in wages to roadmakers would
sensibly alleviate the prevailing distress.  But we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
did not reckon upon Persian avarice, selfishness, and
untrustworthiness of character.  The price of bread,
somewhat to our surprise, did not fall.  In fact it
became dearer than ever.  The bakers saw to that.
Money was beginning to circulate more freely; the
very poor were no longer empty-fisted; so up went
the price of bread with a bound!  In short, it was
found that the more we distributed in famine relief
the lower fell the purchasing power of the kran.
Another thing, too, that militated against the
successful working of the "all cash" scheme of assistance
was that it did not to any extent ameliorate the
pitiable lot of the women and children.  The men
did not always bother to buy bread for their starving
dependents, preferring to dissipate their earnings in
a nightly carouse in an opium den&mdash;the local
equivalent to a British gin palace.
</p>

<p>
An unpleasant element of "graft" was also brought
to light.  No Persian for very long can keep his
itching fingers from other people's money.  The
native foremen of the road gangs were not an exception
to the rule, and for a brief period they made a
lucrative income by trafficking in labour tickets.
First they issued spurious ones to their friends and
relatives, none of whom had done a stroke of work;
they even sought, somewhat clumsily to be sure, to
counterfeit the official stamp which each ticket bore
on its face.  They rubbed some Indian ink on the
reverse side of a two-kran piece, and with this stamped
the forged tickets, adding a few pencil strokes <i>à la
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
fantasie</i> by way of giving a finishing touch of
verisimilitude.
</p>

<p>
As the tickets entitled the bearers to draw four
krans when presented nightly at the pay office, the
thieving foremen were in a fair way to becoming rich
by the time the fraud was discovered.  The same
individuals were also in the habit of coercing their
hapless underlings into selling their tickets for a
kran or two.  These were then resold to a middleman,
who cashed them at their full face value.  But
a liberal application of the bastinado worked wonders,
and speedily rendered such dishonest practices highly
unpopular.
</p>

<p>
Still, it was felt that some radical alteration was
necessary if we were to get full value for, and the
Hamadan poor full benefit from, the money that was
being expended on their behalf.  General Byron, a
level-headed practical soldier, and very wise in
worldly knowledge, who at this time was second in
command to General Dunsterville, now took over
control of famine relief work.  He decided upon an
alteration of the existing system of doles in favour
of one consisting of a free distribution in food
supplemented by payment in cash of two krans instead of
four.  Bread alone was deemed to be insufficient,
and it was felt that the starving people who toiled
daily road-making required some more nourishing
food.  After overcoming many difficulties, official as
well as unofficial, and silencing the usual group of
objectors who vowed that it could not be done, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
General opened soup kitchens at several centres, and
fed as many as 2,000 hungry people per day.
</p>

<p>
The recipients were delighted and grateful.  But it
was now that the local Democrats, who throughout
had stood aloof from the movement for succouring
their starving brethren, reached their high-level of
political strategy.  It was not at all to their liking
that the detested British interloper was filling the
empty stomachs of the people gratis.  In such
circumstances they could not be expected to revolt and
join hands with the Democrats, and besides, if this
free distribution of food were not stopped, it would
be a bad day for the wheat-trust and inflated grain
prices.  So they set to work and issued broadcast
handbills warning the poor against partaking of
British soup, on the ground that it was heavily
flavoured with poison.  It was part of another
"deep-laid plot," they said, to kill off all the Hamadani
whom the ravages of famine had so far overlooked.
</p>

<p>
The average Persian peasant is an ignorant and
gullible individual as a rule, but this time the
Democrats overshot the mark and their assertions were
too much even for Persian credulity.  The hungry
people came and ate.  The second and succeeding
days they came in thousands.  Barricades and armed
soldiers were required to prevent their storming the
distribution centres and carrying off all the available
supply.  And, to the dismay and horror of all good
Democrats, not a single one died from poisoning.
This was the deathblow to the prestige of the Democratic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
movement.  It lost its grip on the people.
There is nothing a Persian, or indeed any Oriental,
hates so much as being made to look ridiculous;
and the Democrats became the target for quip and
jest in the bazaars of Hamadan, until in rage they
plucked their beards and tore their garments,
exclaiming, in accents of sorrow and humiliation, "Alas,
what ashes have fallen on our heads to-day!"
</p>

<p>
But they rallied in their last ditch, and made an
eleventh-hour attempt to avert the consequences of
the moral defeat which had overtaken them.  Kuchik
Khan, the "Robin Hood" of the Caspian Marches,
yielding to democratic pleadings, and in the hope
possibly of discrediting British famine relief work,
sent fifteen mule-loads of rice to Hamadan to be sold
for the benefit of the poor.  But Kuchik's agents
had seized the rice without payment from growers
living in his "protected area," so he was able to
play the merry game of robbing the Persian Peter
in order to comfort the Persian Paul.
</p>

<p>
The artifice was too thin.  Hamadan was not
deluded.  The British were <i>de facto</i> masters of the
situation.  They had conquered the people of
Hamadan not by the sword and halter of the Turk who
had preceded them, but by a modern adaptation of
the miracle of the loaves and fishes.
</p>

<p>
By a <i>ruse de guerre</i> the grain owners were induced
to disgorge some of their hoarded stocks.  Telegrams
purposely written <i>en clair</i> which passed between
Bagdad and Hamadan made it appear that large
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
supplies of wheat were being forwarded from
Mesopotamia, whereupon the local Hamadan hoarders
rushed into the market and sold readily at daily
diminishing rates, until something like normal prices
were reached once more.  And so the bottom fell out
of the wheat ring.
</p>

<p>
Private foreign effort closely co-operated with the
military in the distribution of food and the relief of
the famine-stricken.  Dr. Funk and Mr. Allen of the
American Presbyterian Mission, Mr. McMurray of the
Imperial Bank of Persia, and Mr. Edwards, local
manager of the Persian Carpet Factory, amongst them
spent considerable sums of money and devoted a
great deal of time to this work of charity.
</p>

<p>
Mr. McMurray is a man possessing much business
acumen and financial ability, and as expert adviser
to the British in occupation at Hamadan he was
able to render very great services to his country.
Too modest to seek reward or recompense of any
kind, he nevertheless had an honour thrust upon
him.  It was a minor class of a minor decoration
which a grateful Government in England somewhat
grudgingly, it seems, bestowed upon him in generous
recognition of his zealous labour in the common
cause of Empire.  So now, should he attend a public
function at home, and the question of precedence
arise, he will probably find himself ranking next after
some lady typist from the War Office, who can write
shorthand and spell with tolerable accuracy.  To be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
an unofficial Briton working for Britain abroad is a
very serious handicap for the Briton concerned.  The
Government of the Empire sees to that.  I have never
been able to discover exactly why it is, but the
handicap holds good all the way from Tokio to
Teheran, and from Salonika to Archangel.  Should
you desire to acquire merit, and you happen to be
the possessor of a name that betokens pure British
ancestry, hide it, and let it be inferred that the cradle
of your race is somewhere in Palestine or the Middle
East.  Then your path is easy.  The India Office will
pat you on the back, and the British Foreign Office
will ecstatically fold you to its bosom.
</p>

<p>
McMurray's bungalow was the chief trysting-place
for the British officers in Hamadan.  It stands within
the great walled enclosure or compound where many
members of the British and American colonies had
made their homes.  It was a city within a city,
fringed with trees and pleasant pathways, and
bordered by flower-beds.  Mrs. McMurray was always
"at home" to her compatriots from about 10 a.m. to
10 p.m. daily.  While she fed starving Persians,
she also gave luncheons and dinners to British officers.
Rarely were there fewer than six of the latter billeted
under her hospitable roof.  The eaglets of the R.A.F.,
and especially the fledglings still without their second
wing, found her an admirable foster-mother, who
counselled them in health and nursed them in illness,
and was always a sympathetic amanuensis when
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
fevered brows and unsteady hands attempted to
grapple with the problem of inditing a "line or two"
for home to catch the outgoing mail.
</p>

<p>
Dunsterville, as he was popularly called, was a
frequent visitor at the bungalow.  The original of
Kipling's "Stalky," he rode easily and without
straining on the anchor of his reputation.  He is
keen-witted, with an illimitable fund of dry, racy
humour, and no drawing-room was ever dull when
the General was having his fling.  As a retailer of
<i>bon mots</i> the G.O.C. had no compeer in Hamadan.
His shafts were never envenomed, and his victims
laughed as heartily as anybody else, as, for instance,
once when rations were running low and cannibalism
was in vogue among the poor of the city, Dunsterville,
turning to a very youthful A.D.C. whose cheeks
were the colour of a ripe apple, said in his droll
way, "I shall never starve, my lad, while you are
about!"
</p>

<p>
One of his <i>obiter dicta</i> was that every British officer
in Persia should be compelled to pass a qualifying
examination in "Hadji Baba"&mdash;the Oriental Gil
Blas&mdash;for he would then know more about the
Persians, their manners and customs, than could
be acquired by months of travel and unaided
observation.
</p>

<p>
"Stalky" had no fear of personal danger.  He
was an optimist who always saw a diamond-studded
lining to the blackest of clouds.  It is related of him
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
that at his fateful interview with the Bolsheviks on
the occasion of his raid on Resht he told the "Red
Committee" so many amusing stories in their own
mother-tongue that they quite forgot the principal
business of the evening, which was to sentence him
(Dunsterville) to death.

CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
DUNSTERVILLE STRIKES AFRESH
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Official hindrances&mdash;A fresh blow for the Caucasus&mdash;The long
road to Tabriz&mdash;A strategic centre&mdash;A Turkish invasion&mdash;Rising
of Christian tribes&mdash;A local Joan of Arc&mdash;The British
project.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By the middle of May Dunsterville began to feel his
feet.  Reinforcements were trickling in, officers and
N.C.O's., but no fighting men, and always in the
<i>petits paquets</i> so beloved by the parsimonious-minded
officials who sat at General Headquarters down in
Bagdad.
</p>

<p>
Dunsterville's own position was not an enviable
one.  His path was beset by difficulties of every
description, and, much against his wish, he found
himself engaged in a kind of triangular duel with
British officialdom at home and abroad.  First the
Minister in Teheran, and apparently also the Foreign
Office, were wringing their hands in despair, asking
what he was doing in Persia at all, and urging him
to "move on" towards the Caucasus.  Next there
was Bagdad, who, deeply incensed that Dunsterville
had an independent command, and was in direct
communication with the War Office, never lost a
chance of putting a retarding spoke in his wheel,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
even going to the extent of telegraphing up the line
that no member of "Dunsterforce" was to be
furnished with supplies from the military canteens.
Then, finally, there was the War Office, who had sent
him to Persia in the first instance because it was the
most direct route to the centre of Bolshevik activities
in the Caucasus.  For some time they continued to
support him against the pretensions of Bagdad, but
ultimately they yielded, and Dunsterville and his
force became subordinate to the Bagdad command.
Of course, there were, in addition, the malcontents
amongst the Persians, notably the Democrats and
their Turkish-German sympathizers, who had more
than a passing interest in all this bickering and
wrangling.  They, too, were anxious that a British
force should not sit down indefinitely in Persia.
</p>

<p>
At last it was determined to do something and to
strike a fresh blow for the Caucasus; but the initiative
no longer rested with Dunsterville.  It had passed
to Bagdad.  New difficulties arose immediately.
How were the Caucasus to be reached&mdash;by the
Caspian Sea and thence by steamer to Baku?  Or
overland from northwards, through the province of
Azarbaijan to Tabriz and railhead?
</p>

<p>
The direct route to the Caspian from Hamadan
was not possible, because Kuchik Khan and his
Jungalis still held the Manjil-Resht section of the road,
and Dunsterville unaided was not then strong enough
to turn them out.  True, there were the Russian
auxiliaries under Bicherakoff, but these valued allies
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
were making ready for an offensive in their own
leisurely fashion, and were not to be "speeded up"
by any known methods of British hustling.
</p>

<p>
From Hamadan to Tabriz by way of Zinjan is
about three hundred miles.  The route for the most
part lies over difficult and mountainous country,
where supplies are scarce or hard to procure.  The
wild and scattered tribesmen are not noted for
extreme friendliness.  Zinjan itself is 115 miles from
Hamadan in a northerly direction.  The next
important stage on the road to Tabriz is Mianeh,
eighty-five miles north-west of Zinjan.  From Mianeh,
Tabriz itself is distant about one hundred miles.
</p>

<p>
Tabriz, the ancient Tauris, and capital of the
province of Azarbeijan, is the largest city in the
Persian Empire, and the most important commercial
centre in all Iran.  It is the residence of the Valiahd,
or heir-apparent to the Persian throne.  It occupies
much the same position in north-western Persia as
does Meshed in the north-eastern part of the country.
Marco Polo visited it during his long overland trek
to far Cathay, and found it a fair city, full of busy
merchants and wealthy citizens.
</p>

<p>
But for the British, seeking to arrive within
fighting distance of the Turks, Germans, and Russian
Bolsheviks overrunning the Caucasus, Tabriz had its
own special military importance.  It was a point of
great strategic value.  Julfa, on the Russian-Persian
frontier, and ninety miles from Tabriz, is the terminus
of the Trans-Caucasian Railway which runs to Tiflis,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
the Caucasian capital and main British objective.
Tiflis is 320 miles from Tabriz.  The railway from
the former city continues west to Poti and Batum,
the shipping ports on the Black Sea, and east (also
from Tiflis Junction) to Baku and its oilfields on the
Caspian Sea.
</p>

<p>
From Julfa, connecting with the Trans-Caucasian
Railway, a Russian company had built a branch line
to Tabriz, and an extension to Sharaf Khane on the
eastern shore of Lake Urumia.  On the lake itself
was a fleet of Russian-owned steamers, which
maintained communication between the railhead at Sharaf
Khane and Urumia city, famous as the legendary
birthplace of Zoroaster, which is on the western shore
of the lake, and about twenty-five miles from Sharaf
Khane.
</p>

<p>
When the Russian Army, stricken by the deadly
plague of Bolshevism, retreated northwards towards
Tiflis, they accommodatingly left behind at Sharaf
Khane, for the use of the first comer, their fleet of
lake steamers, hundreds of guns of heavy and medium
calibre, dumps of shells and small-arms ammunition,
thousands of serviceable rifles, and quantities of other
military stores.
</p>

<p>
The Turkish frontier line, passing about forty-five
miles west of Urumia, continues due north to its
junction with the territorial boundaries of Russia
and Persia on the perpetual snow-clad summit of
the Greater Mount Ararat.  The region round Lake
Van having been cleared of potential enemies&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
Russians had retired, and the Armenians were put
to the sword&mdash;the Turks, swinging eastward, lost no
time in crossing the frontier and violating Persian
territory.  They pleaded military exigencies for the
step they had taken, and turned a very deaf and
unsympathetic ear to the mere paper remonstrances
of the Persian Government.  But in the invaded
territory they met with severe and unexpected
opposition, not from their own Islamic kindred, but from
hated and despised Infidels of the Christian sect.
</p>

<p>
Urumia is the centre of a thickly populated
Christian district, and the headquarters of French,
Armenian, American, Russian, and British religious
missions to the Nestorian Christians.  These latter,
with few exceptions, inhabit the plains and lowlands;
but in the bleak, almost inaccessible mountain regions,
live and thrive some brave and warlike tribes who
are also Nestorian Christians, and who are generically
known as Jelus.  They had suffered much from
religious persecution at the hands of Kurd, Persian,
and Turk, and over and over again in their mountain
eyries, with rifles in their hands, they had put up a
brave fight against the Moslem oppressor in defence
of hearth and home and the temples of their faith.
</p>

<p>
Nestorians and Jelus once more made common
cause against the common Turkish enemy.  Already
warned by the fate of the hapless Armenians, they
were under no delusion as to what would befall them
should the Osmanli triumph&mdash;it meant extermination,
root and branch.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
</p>

<p>
Badly equipped and badly armed, but heroically
led, the combined Jelu Army took the field under
Agre Petros, generalissimo, and Mar Shimon, the
Nestorian Patriarch.  With the latter went his sister,
Surma Khanin, who fought in the ranks of the
Christian army, and whose lion-like bravery and
devotion under enemy fire speedily led to her being
known as the Nestorian Jeanne d'Arc.
</p>

<p>
A force of Turkish regulars belonging to the 6th
Division, plundering and burning as it went, on
May 17th was surprised by the Jelus on the River
Barandoz, south of Urumia, and cut to pieces, the
victors capturing the guns and greater part of the
supplies.  Thus came to naught the Turkish plan for
the taking of Urumia by means of a combined attack
from the south and from Salmas in the north!  The
captured artillery and supplies gave the Jelus a new
lease of military life, and they were able for some
time afterwards to keep the Turk at bay.  Everyone
realized that, without military help from the British,
the Urumia Christians must be overwhelmed by the
Turks sooner or later.
</p>

<p>
This, then, was briefly the situation towards the
middle of May.  The Turk, battered and bruised after
his encounter with the Jelus, was pulling himself
together for another and more carefully prepared
spring.  He hung around Khoi, whence he threatened
Urumia on the western shore of the lake, and Sharaf
Khane and its rich booty of Russian guns and military
stores on the eastern shore.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
</p>

<p>
While the Turk was probably inwardly debating
whether he should not bring matters to a climax by
descending on Tabriz to possess himself of the Persian
end of the Trans-Caucasian Railway and the Russian
military stores at Sharaf Khane all at one swoop,
some official folk in remote Bagdad and remoter
London were discussing between themselves with
great earnestness and energy whether it would not
be possible and practicable to forestall him by
marching a column from Hamadan to occupy Tabriz, seize
the railhead, establish a base for operations against
Tiflis and the Caucasus generally, and stretch out a
helping hand to the sorely pressed Nestorian-Jelu
Army on the other side of Lake Urumia.

DRILLING JELUS AT HAMADAN.
</p>

<p>
The British Minister in Teheran got wind of the
project and jumped upon it heavily.  The Persians
would not like it; it would offend their
susceptibilities; they were almost certain to be annoyed,
and diplomatic complications, etc., etc., were sure to
follow.  It is a little way British Ministers
sometimes have.  They become over-zealous and
over-cautious, ever dreading a hair-breadth departure
from the narrow limits of the conventional protocol.
There followed a good deal of official wobbling and
indecision.  First the "Ayes" had it, then the
"Noes," and meanwhile much precious time was
wasted.  Ultimately, some strong man somewhere&mdash;it
is rumoured that he lives down Whitehall way&mdash;got
a firm grip of the problem, and flung his weight
into the scale on the side of the "Ayes"; and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
"Noes," including the far-seeing Minister, were
routed.
</p>

<p>
The word "go" was given in Hamadan, and then
began the great Olympian race&mdash;the goal Tabriz,
with Turk and Briton pitted one against the
other.

CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
THE RACE FOR TABRIZ
</h3>

<p class="intro">
A scratch pack for a great adventure&mdash;Wagstaff of
Persia&mdash;Among the Afshars&mdash;Guests of the chief&mdash;Capture of
Zinjan&mdash;Peace and profiteering.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On May 21st a small British column left Hamadan
for the north-west of Persia.  It was anything but
a formidable fighting force as far as numerical strength
was concerned.  It comprised fifteen British officers,
one French officer, and about thirty-five British
N.C.O's.  The whole party was armed with rifles
and some also carried swords, infantry or cavalry
pattern, which had been dug out of the Ordnance
Store at the last moment.
</p>

<p>
Even as our equipment was varied, so was there
certainly something distinctly Quixotic about our
saddlery and our chargers.  Of the latter, some were
a fresh issue by the Remount Department, and ranged
from heavy limber horses to light 'Walers.  Then
there were Persian "Rosinantes," bare-boned and
razor-backed.  The humble Persian mule and humbler
donkey were also impressed into the service of carrying
some British officer or sergeant forward on the
great adventure.
</p>

<p>
For adventure it certainly was.  Our orders were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
to march on Zinjan, where a few hundred Turks were
said to be holding a post, defeat or disperse them,
raise and train Persian levies, and, with these auxiliaries
to aid us in the fighting line, push on to Tabriz,
and, if possible, dispose of any Turks who might be
inclined to dispute our entry into the capital of
Azarbaijan.  We had a Lewis gun, but no artillery.
We had a medical officer, but scant medical and
surgical stores; no ambulance or stretchers, but a
couple of dhoolies, to each of which a mule was
harnessed fore and aft.  Baggage and supplies were
cut down to a minimum, for the column, if such it
could be termed, was to be self-supporting, and to
live on the country, not always an easy task in the
starving land of Persia.
</p>

<p>
This British forlorn hope was led by Major Wagstaff
of the Indian Army, an officer who had spent
years in Persia attached to the South Persia Rifles,
and had an intimate knowledge of the Persian as
a fighter and as an intriguer.  Wagstaff spoke the
language of the country with great fluency, and
knew all the tribes from Fars to Azarbaijan with the
intimacy of an ethnological connoisseur.  I remember
that he held the Persian in high esteem, believed
him to be courageous to a certain extent, honest
according to his lights, and altogether possessing the
makings of a soldier.  But then Wagstaff was born
an optimist!
</p>

<p>
Our route lay due north from Hamadan to Zinjan,
where it was intended that we should cut in on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
main Tabriz road that runs from Teheran by way
of Kasvin.  The Turks, too, had been active in this
district lately.  Small reconnoitring parties of them
were said to have made their way down through
Azarbaijan to the neighbourhood of Mianeh and
Zinjan, in quest of supplies and military information.
In a sense they were operating on favourable ground,
for a large proportion of the inhabitants of
Azarbaijan are of Turkish origin.  They belong to the
same race as the Turks on the north side of the
Araxes (Russian-Persian frontier) who occupy the
valley from Julfa to Erivan, and with whom those in
Azarbaijan have blood ties.
</p>

<p>
The Afshari is one of the powerful Turkish tribes
known as Kizil Bashis, which settled in Persia in the
seventeenth century, and at the present day more
than a quarter of the descendants of the Afshari live
in Azarbaijan.  It was to smash the growing power
of these newcomers from across the Persian border
that Shah Abbas organized the tribesmen in
north-eastern Azarbaijan, who were known as
Shahsavans&mdash;"Shah loving."  But their loyalty did not last
long.  They soon turned their arms against their
royal master, and joined the Russians in the
campaign of 1826, forming an enduring alliance with
their tribal enemies, whom they ultimately absorbed
into their bosom.  The Shahsavans are a turbulent
crew, well aware of their strength and fighting value,
and have from time to time terrorized the Persian
Government.  In 1912 they revolted in the vicinity
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
of Ardabil, and it took a combined Persian-Russian
force of five thousand men and a four months'
campaign to suppress them.
</p>

<p>
After six days' march we were in the country of
the Afshar tribe, one of the five main branches of
Shahsavans, which is credited with being able to put
a thousand mounted and armed men in the field.
The chief of the Afshars, Jahan, Shah Jahan, we
found sojourning in one of his villages called Karasf.
A day's march from this village we were met by a
messenger from the Amir Afshar, as he is generally
called, who invited us to make a detour and break our
journey at Karasf.
</p>

<p>
It was at the close of a hot, dusty afternoon that
we reached the Amir's abode, very tired after a long
march.  The Amir's headman bade us welcome, and
announced that we were to be the guests of his master
during our stay.  The customary sacrificial offering
of sheep was made in our honour, and our horses
were led away by native mihtaran or syces.  As for
ourselves, we were installed in a spacious
caravanserai with a retinue of servants to wait upon us.
The Amir Afshar proved an admirable host, and
supplies were forthcoming in abundance from the
many villages in his domains.
</p>

<p>
Ascertaining that several members of the party
were poorly mounted, he sent us six horses, the very
best of his blood stock.  The Amir lives in semi-regal
style, and, as paramount chief of the Afshar
tribe, is lord of his people and the arbiter of the lives
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
and fortunes of about five thousand tribal families,
who render him unswerving, unquestioning obedience.
Here was ancient feudalism in the heart of the
twentieth-century Persian Empire!  Although owing
a nominal allegiance to the "King of Kings" in
Teheran, the Amir apparently did not bother his
head very much about party intrigues or the trend
of national politics at the Court of the Shah.  He
did his own intriguing, and did it exceptionally well.
A man of extraordinary ability and political shrewdness,
he first coquetted with the Turks and then with
the British, adroitly playing one off against the other
in the great game of politics.  Too careful to commit
himself irrevocably to one side or the other while
the Great World War was still undecided, this
Oriental Vicar of Bray nevertheless contrived to
maintain a cordial and unbroken friendship with
both Turk and Briton.  If a Turkish emissary,
backing up his persuasive pleadings with a bag of
gold, besought him to put an end to neutrality and to
place his resources and his small army of irregulars
at the service of his blood relatives, the Amir always
accepted the gold cheerfully, and fervently wished
success to the Turkish arms.  Then the British, not
to be outdone by the Turk, would ask, as a guarantee
of his good faith, for fifty or a hundred armed levies
from amongst his tribesmen.  The Amir invariably
agreed in principle, but he would point out that no
self-respecting Afshari could fight at his best unless
equipped with a British rifle.  The latest pattern
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
army rifle would be forthcoming to the number
required, but then a border foray would always be
staged about the same time, and the wily Amir
would plead, and with some show of reason, that he
needed every sowar he had to prevent his territory
being overrun by his powerful and unscrupulous
tribal neighbours.  Still, for all that, during the
darkest of the famine days, he kept the British
commissariat well supplied with grain, and that, too, at
a reasonable price.
</p>

<p>
Our host was usually "at home" to distinguished
visitors from four to five a.m.  He sent to say that
the state of his health forbade his receiving us at the
more conventional hour of noon.  The Amir, I
learned afterwards, was a confirmed opium-eater, his
daily dose of the drug being far in excess of the
quantity consumed by our own candid de Quincey.
He was an old man, verging on eighty, but although
his physical health was indifferent, his mental energies
were unimpaired.  He rarely ventured abroad, and
spent his days and nights in the privacy of his
apartment, abandoning himself to the full enjoyment
of his enthralling passion of opium-eating.  At
daylight he was usually recovering from his latest dose
of the drug.  Then he would partake of a little food,
see callers, read his letters, and depart for dreamland
again, carried thither on the wings of the insidious
and baneful poppy extract.
</p>

<p>
One morning at dawn the members of the Wagstaff
Mission paid a ceremonial call on the Amir.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
Fortunately we were accustomed to early rising.  We
were conducted to his presence with considerable
ceremony, and found him reclining on the floor of
a large apartment covered with rare Persian rugs.
There was little else in the way of furniture in the
place.  I saw before me an old man with shrivelled,
sunken features, piercing black eyes, and a grey
beard growing on a face the colour of yellow parchment.
A long, thin, bony hand was held out for us
to shake in turn, the Amir excusing himself from
rising on account of physical weakness.  He bade us
welcome in a quavering, piping voice.
</p>

<p>
Whatever else may have been his infirmities, it
soon became clear that he had a remarkably alert
brain.  The most recent phases of the European War,
the varying fortunes of the participants engaged
therein, the latest tit-bit of scandal from Teheran,
and the pretensions of the Turks to territorial
occupation of Azarbaijan and possible aggrandizement at
the expense of Persia, all these topics drew from the
aged but mentally virile potentate pungent and
sagacious criticism.  He talked high strategy with
all the assurance of a Field-Marshal, and gleefully
told how he had politically out-manoeuvred the wily,
calculating Turk in a recent little <i>affaire à deux</i>.
While he spoke he ran his hand idly through a pile
of correspondence, read and unread, opened and
unopened, which littered the floor beside him.
Letter-filing has evidently not reached any high standard at
Karasf.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I think we all fell under the spell of our host's
well-informed mind and his world-wide interests,
and when he asked if there had been any Cabinet
changes recently in London, and whether Lloyd
George was still Chief Minister of our King, we
felt that the march of contemporary events, rapid
indeed as they can be sometimes, had failed to
outstrip the keen alertness of the overlord of
Karasf.
</p>

<p>
On May 29th, having previously exchanged adieux
with our kindly host, we set out from Karasf.  The
weather was now oppressively hot, and it was
becoming increasingly difficult to march during the
noon-day heat.  We accordingly moved off earlier, and
usually contrived to take the road about sunrise
daily, halted at noon for an hour or so, and then on
again, finishing the day's march early in the
afternoon in the welcome shade of some garden on the
outskirts of a village and close to a good
water-supply.
</p>

<p>
A day's trek from Karasf took us beyond the
confines of the Amir's territory.  Couriers whom he
had despatched in advance of us warned his local
headmen of our coming, and we lacked nothing in
the way of supplies.  We crossed rough, broken
country, wound over mountain passes, and down into
pleasant valleys beyond.  Our advent, it was clear,
caused much excitement in the countryside, but the
people, while they sometimes held aloof, were never
unfriendly.  We were passing through a country less
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
ravaged by starvation than the region close
to Hamadan.  Food was more plentiful, and
the "hunger battalion," with its suffering
members, was not to be seen in the Persian
North-West.
</p>

<p>
We were also gradually losing touch with Persian
as a spoken language.  It was being supplanted by
Turki, the dialect of Turkish-Persian spoken by the
peasant classes in the province of Azarbaijan.  As
we rode north we were sensible of this linguistic
change.  First the peasants we met in the village
spoke Persian and understood Turki; farther north
Persian was understood, but not spoken with any
fluency; until, north and north-west of Zinjan, Turki
entirely ousts the native Persian, the latter as a
spoken language in many cases being quite unknown
to the villagers.
</p>

<p>
So far we had seen nothing of any hostile Turks.
A body of their cavalry and a few infantry were
reported to be at Zinjan, but the villagers told us
they had not come farther south, or anywhere in the
neighbourhood of our own line of march.  A few
robber bands occasionally quitted their mountain
lairs and descended into the plain, taking us for
some peaceful merchant caravan, probably unarmed,
and therefore an easy prey for these wild freebooters
of the hills.  But, on reconnoitring closer and
discovering their mistake, they did not tarry, and
turning about, went off into the hills as fast as their
wiry ponies could carry them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon of May 30th we arrived within
ten miles of Zinjan, and camped on a bare and
desolate sand tract close to the main road.  A Persian
tea-house, with its walls crumbling to ruins, stood
by the wayside.  Tea there was none, and the
occupier had disappeared, leaving his establishment
to the care of the wild dogs and prowling hill robbers
that nightly infested it.  It was empty now, and
abominably filthy, so I sat outside under the lee of
the tea-house wall which afforded a little protection
from the scorching heat, holding a very tired horse,
and waiting for the sun to take himself from off the
hot plain in order that we might seek both rest and
refreshment.
</p>

<p>
At daylight on May 31st we broke camp early and
moved cautiously forward in the hope of surprising
the Turkish force in Zinjan, leaving the baggage and
stores behind under a guard.  Our total striking
force was thirty all told, half of which was under
Major Wagstaff and the remainder under Captain
Osborne, 2nd King Edward's Horse.
</p>

<p>
Zinjan is a town of 24,000 inhabitants, shut in by
high hills on the east and west, between which lies
an immense plain traversed by the Zinjaneh Rud.
On both banks of this river are beautiful gardens
enclosed by walls of baked brick.  If the Turks
meant to make a stand here, they had found an
admirable defensive position, and one from which it
would take a couple of battalions to dislodge them.
Osborne's party worked round to the west and north
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
in order to threaten the retreat of the enemy, while
Wagstaff and his small band, including myself,
halted under cover of a garden wall to the south of the
town.
</p>

<p>
Some Persian Charvadars coming out of the town
volunteered the information that the Turks holding
Zinjan, whose numbers were variously estimated at
from two to three hundred, were already in flight,
and galloping away northwards as hard as they
could go.  The news of our approach must have
reached them early.  No doubt our numerical strength
had been magnified tenfold by the imaginative native
spy who had carried the intelligence of our
advance.
</p>

<p>
This information decided Wagstaff.  In a moment
we had flung ourselves into the saddles and, with a
wild British cheer that shook sleepy folk out of their
beds, we dashed across the stone bridge spanning the
river and so into Zinjan.  We rode first for the
bazaars, hoping to round up in that quarter some
stray Turks who had overstayed their leave when
the town was being evacuated.  But we found
none.
</p>

<p>
If our sudden arrival failed to surprise the Turks,
it certainly alarmed the inhabitants of Zinjan.  Panic
seized them.  In the bazaars the women and children
fled at our approach, and the shopkeepers, trembling
in every limb, made frantic efforts to bolt and bar
their premises.  Finding that the new-comers neither
robbed nor maltreated anyone, the bazaar lost its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
attack of "nerves," and recovered its habitual calm.
Business instincts got the better of physical fear.
Shutters came down with a run, and as a slight
token of local appreciation, and in honour of our
coming, all bazaar prices were immediately, and by
universal consent, increased one hundred per cent.

CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
CAPTURE OF MIANEH
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Armoured car causes consternation&mdash;Reconnoitring the
road&mdash;Flying column sets out&mdash;An easy capture at the gates of
Tabriz&mdash;Tribesmen raid the armoured car&mdash;And have a thin
time&mdash;Turks get the wind up.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Zinjan having thus passed into our hands without
the firing of a shot, the Wagstaff column established
its headquarters in a garden villa a mile north of the
town, near the junction of the road to Mianeh.  The
Indo-European Telegraph Company had an office in
Zinjan, and we were speedily in communication with
Kasvin, eighty miles to the south-east.
</p>

<p>
Osborne's small party soon turned up, having
failed to round up any Turks.  Indeed, the latter
bolted from Zinjan with amazing celerity, so much
so that their commandant, Major Ghalib Bey, left
behind some of his papers and personal effects.
</p>

<p>
During our march on Zinjan, Dunsterville
headquarters had moved up from Hamadan to Kasvin
in order the more effectively to co-operate with
Bicherakoff and his Russian volunteers in the
impending operations against Kuchik Khan and his
Jungalis, who were holding the Manjil-Resht road.
</p>

<p>
A few hours after we had taken peaceable possession
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
of Zinjan, Lieutenant Pierpont, with a light
armoured car mounting a machine-gun and a Ford
convoy bringing supplies for our force, arrived from
Kasvin.  The car, as it lumbered through the narrow
bazaar streets, scraping its way round sharp corners
where there was scarcely room to swing a cat, visibly
impressed the susceptible native mind, and damped
the pro-Turkish enthusiasm of the militant local
Democrats.  Its presence exercised a salutary moral
influence, and although there were mutterings of
discontent at our unceremonious seizure of the town,
the stodgy barrel of the machine-gun peeping from
the turret of the armoured car was in itself sufficient
to overawe all the anti-British hotheads of Zinjan.
</p>

<p>
On the morning following our arrival in Zinjan
Major Wagstaff sent me off with the armoured car
to reconnoitre the road towards Mianeh.  I had
with me Lieutenant Pierpont, who was in charge of
the car and its crew of three, and Lieutenant
Poidebard of the French Army, who was attached to our
column.  In addition to the car there were a couple
of Ford vans carrying spare petrol and stores for the
journey.  Official road reports in our possession
covering the section of the route between Zinjan and
Mianeh were indefinite and even conflicting.  The
road ahead was in places reputed to be "good for
wheeled transport," but whether it was passable for
an armoured car was highly problematical.
</p>

<p>
Our first day's journey was devoid of thrill.  We
forded the shallow waters of the Zinjan Rud and one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
of its tributary streams, towed the car in places with
the two Fords as tugs, and at others built a plank
bridge to carry it over deep mud holes.
</p>

<p>
At the village of Nik Be, or Nikhbeg, which is
about thirty miles from our starting-point, the
inhabitants fled in terror at the sight of the strange
iron-clad monster moving down the village high
street.  The very dogs took fright and set out for
some remote part of Azerbaijan with their tails
between their legs.  Even the usually placid
transport donkey was not proof against the prevailing
infection of fear, and kicking his load free, he betook
himself elsewhere.  The general impression appeared
to be that the Evil One himself had dropped in for
a morning call.  In five minutes from our entry into
the village not a human face was to be seen, and
a silence as of death itself reigned everywhere.
Presently we dug out some of the terrified villagers
from various subterranean hiding-places and
prevailed upon them to inspect the "monster" at close
range.  Finding it now stood the test well, and that
it behaved in a rational way, they grew bolder, and
patted its khaki-painted sides affectionately, as one
would stroke a dog of dubious friendliness.
</p>

<p>
On the succeeding day, by dint of a good deal of
spade work, we reached Jamalabad, about fifteen
miles from Mianeh, where the road approaches the
Baleshkent Pass.  The ascent to the pass from the
Jamalabad side is about three miles from the village,
and the road mounts abruptly at a very sharp angle.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
On the reverse slope it zigzags down the side of a
gorge which made one giddy to look at.  It required
the united efforts of fifty sturdy villagers from
Jamalabad to push the car to the top of the pass,
but, even if we could have negotiated the descent in
safety, it was doubtful if we should ever have been
able to climb back by the precipitous corkscrew
ascent.
</p>

<p>
To be caught by the Turks at the bottom of the
Pass unsupported would mean disaster for the
expedition, so very reluctantly we turned the armoured
car's head for Zinjan.  We learned that there were
Turks in Mianeh, but none of those who had quitted
Zinjan in such haste before the advance of the
Wagstaff column had come along the Jamalabad road.
</p>

<p>
Pierpont, who was in charge of the car, was a
mild-mannered youth, but of a very warlike disposition,
and was much disappointed that we had not had a
brush with his old enemy, the Turk.  Down
Mesopotamia way he once charged an infantry position
and engaged in "close action" by laying his armoured
car alongside a front-line trench, where he speedily
closed the account of its defenders with machine-gun
fire.
</p>

<p>
Another swift stroke now placed us in possession
of Mianeh and brought us eighty miles nearer Tabriz.
</p>

<p>
Captain Osborne, taking with him a small detachment
from Wagstaff's force, as well as a contingent
of hastily recruited Persian irregulars, was
despatched from Zinjan over the recently reconnoitred
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
route.  He had a convoy of Ford vans, took with
him the armoured car under Lieutenant Pierpont, and
pushed forward rapidly, negotiating the difficult
Baleshkent and the still more difficult Kuflan Kuh
Passes.  The Kuflan Kuh at its highest point is
5,750 feet, and the ascent on the south side and
descent on the north side are very difficult for ordinary
wheeled transport.  This is especially so on the
south slope, which, in a series of short, sharp gradients
rises 2,000 feet in two miles.
</p>

<p>
By the aid of a good deal of native labour the
armoured car was safely taken over the formidable
Kuflan Kuh, and duly made its appearance in Mianeh.
The Turks were reported to have had a small post
here, but when Osborne's party entered Mianeh the
enemy had already withdrawn towards the north-west.
</p>

<p>
The premises of the Indo-European Telegraph
Company, which had a stout wall and a compound,
were selected as British headquarters.  Leaving a
part of his slender command here to hold the place
until Wagstaff and his main body could come up,
Osborne with the armoured-car patrol and a few
British N.C.O's pushed along the Tabriz road,
crossed the Shibley Pass twenty miles south-east of
Tabriz, and reconnoitred up to the gates of the city
itself.  It was a hazardous and daring undertaking,
but it would have succeeded, and we could easily
have won the race to Tabriz and so checkmated the
less enterprising Turks, had a few companies of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
British troops been available to hurry to the support
of Osborne.  But one cannot very well expect the
equivalent of a sergeant's guard to perform the work
of a battalion, and to hold a city of 200,000
inhabitants whose attitude was doubtful from the point of
view of friendship.  So Osborne had to fall back
slowly towards Mianeh.
</p>

<p>
The armoured car had by this time used up all
the spare tyres and inner tubes, and, when the
retirement over the Shibley Pass began, it was going on
bare rims.  Its mobility was impaired, and, while it
could still fight, it certainly could not run, and its
tyreless progress over the mud and boulders which
pass for a road in Azerbaijan was slow and painful.
</p>

<p>
The limping car looked an easy prey to Turk or
prowling robber hordes.  So thought a band of two
hundred Shahsavan tribesmen, as they rode down
from the hills one morning on one of their periodical
forays.  They had watched the car from afar, and
noted its limping gait and its helplessness.
</p>

<p>
In that corner of upper Azerbaijan, from the
Tabriz road east to Ardabil and the Caspian Sea, and
north towards the Russian frontier, there roam free
and unhampered a score or so of sub-tribes of the
Shahsavan Clan, wild and lawless rascals for the
most part, but not wanting in courage or in that
rude chivalry common to the Asiatic hillmen.  The
Shahsavani handle a rifle skilfully.  Pillaging is for
them both a livelihood and a distraction.  They are
the recognized tax-gatherers of the Tabriz road, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
will rob a fat caravan, or disarm and strip the Shah's
Cossacks, with equal impunity.
</p>

<p>
And now the tribesmen got their lesson.  The car
stood on the roadside while Lieutenant Pierpont
and his men were preparing breakfast.  Approaching
to within eight hundred yards, the raiders opened
out, and charged to the accompaniment of wild yells.
Then the machine-gun in the turret of the immobile
car spoke up in reply.  It sprayed the charging
horsemen with lead; they broke and fled; but,
reforming, came on anew.  The gun spat more leaden
hail, and this time the tribesmen had had enough;
they fled in disorder, and ever afterwards gave a
very wide berth to all such devilish contrivances as
armoured cars and machine-guns.
</p>

<p>
The Turks now grew seriously alarmed at our
temerity in threatening to snatch Tabriz from their
impending grasp.  It was the door to the Caucasus
and to one of the Turkish main theatres of military
operations.  It was a prize worth having, and for the
Turks the possession of the capital of Azerbaijan
was of scarcely less vital importance than it was for
the British themselves.  Kuchik Khan had already
effectively barred the gate to Resht and shut us off
from the Caspian on the east; now the Turk was
completing the "bottling-up" process, for he was
closing the door of Tabriz in our face and getting
in the way of our reaching Tiflis in the north.
</p>

REPRESENT ONE ATTEMPT OF THE JUNGALIES TO BLOCK THE ROAD.
</p>

<p>
During the first week in June the Turks bestirred
themselves and began their campaign of close and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
active co-operation with Kuchik Khan.  Turkish
troops hurriedly moved on Tabriz from the
neighbourhood of Khoi and the direction of Julfa.  Ali
Elizan Pasha, who designated himself "Commander
of the Ottoman Army in the province of Azerbaijan,"
issued a flamboyant proclamation addressed to his
dear Persian brethren and co-religionists asking them
to rally to his standard and to make common cause
with his Army of Liberation which was pledged to
free Persia from the thraldom of the Infidel.  So
the Turks moved in, and were welcomed by the
Persian officials and by the Valiahd or heir-presumptive
with manifestations of joy, and the Entente
consuls and citizens of the Entente countries moved
out as fast as slow-moving Persian transport could
carry them.
</p>

<p>
Once in Tabriz, the Turks did not let the grass
grow under their feet.  They were bent on giving
us a Roland for our Oliver.  They assiduously
cultivated the good graces of the local Persian
Democrats, actively identified themselves with the
Ittahad-i-Islam, or Pan-Islamic movement, and set about
the recruiting and training of local levies with which
to harry us in Azerbaijan.  The Turks also formally
notified the Teheran Government that it was their
intention to extend their occupation to the Persian
capital, so as to complete the spiritual and political
resurrection of the Shah's Empire.
</p>

<p>
Mahmud Mukhtar Pasha, a Turkish military leader
of some renown, entered Tabriz on June 15th, gave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
his blessing to the Pan-Islamic propagandist
movement, and promised the militants amongst the
Democrats that there would soon be no British left
in Azerbaijan or elsewhere in Persia to trouble the
peace of mind of those patriots.  The good work
was furthered by such zealous Democrats and
Turkophiles as Hadji Bilouri, Mirza Ismael Noberi, and
the Sheikh Mehamet Biabari, who contrived to
combine piety with politics for a cash consideration.
</p>

<p>
The Turks, while lavish with oratory, were niggardly
with money.  In short, they were bad paymasters,
happily for the British; otherwise the latter would
not have been in Azerbaijan as long as they were.
They enrolled fedais or native levies, but forgot to
pay them, whereupon the levies deserted and took
service with the British down Mianeh way, arguing,
logically enough, if crudely, that Turkish promises
would not buy bread, and that the money of the
Infidel was better than none at all.
</p>

<p>
The Turks, too, by their rapacity early estranged
popular feeling.  They commandeered right and
left without payment, and in the bazaar, at the
point of the pistol, they compelled merchants and
money-changers to accept their depreciated paper
currency at an inflated rate of exchange as against
Persian krans.

CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
LIFE IN MIANEH
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Training local levies&mdash;A city of parasites and rogues&mdash;A knave
turns philanthropist&mdash;Turks getting active&mdash;Osborne's comic
opera force&mdash;Jelus appeal for help&mdash;An aeroplane to the
rescue&mdash;The Democrats impressed&mdash;Women worried by

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When the Wagstaff Mission finally reached Mianeh
from Zinjan it began to collect grain supplies, by
purchase, and set to work to raise and train irregulars.
Although the Persian hates drill and discipline, there
was no dearth of recruits for the local army.  The
pay was good, about £2 a month with rations and
uniform, which meant affluence to the average
Persian villager, who was usually too poor to buy
enough bread to keep himself alive.
</p>

<p>
Mianeh, which is rightfully credited with being
the most unhealthy spot in North-Western Persia,
has a population of about 7,000.  It is the
chosen home of a poisonous bug (Argas Persicus)
whose bite produces severe fever and occasionally
death.  There is also a set of parasites, human this
time, whose sting is very deadly in a financial sense.
They are the Merchants' and Grain-Growers' Guilds,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
and they were always attempting to dip deep and
dishonestly into the British treasure chest.  It
would be doing this delectable spot no injustice to
say that, in proportion to its population, it can
boast a greater percentage of unchained rogues than
any other town in the whole province of Azerbaijan.
</p>

<p>
One of these knaves turned "philanthropist" once.
He begged the Mission to start relief works to help
the starving poor of Mianeh, and offered to supply
the British with spades for excavation work at cost
price.  The spades were paid for and the relief work
started&mdash;and about a week later it was accidentally
discovered that the "philanthropist" was collecting
two krans a day as spade hire from the dole of the
starving peasants!  On another occasion he induced
a too-confiding officer to sanction the payment of a
sum of money for rendering less malodorous the
streets of this pestiferous town.  The money was
drawn, and then its recipient discovered that the
people were partial to noxious vapours, and had
conscientious objections to any interfering and
misguided foreigner meddling with their pet manure
heap.  So nothing was done, but the money
disappeared.  Such is morality as practised in this
corner of the Shah's dominions!
</p>

<p>
The Telegraph Compound which, during our occupation
of Mianeh, served as Wagstaff's headquarters,
stood on the brink of a knoll overlooking the main
street leading to the Bazaar Quarter.  On the face
of a corresponding eminence opposite, and divided
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
by a bend of the road, was the local Potter's Field,
where friendless peasants and penniless wanderers
from afar who had paid the great debt of Nature
within the inhospitable walls of Mianeh were interred
(when the lazy townsfolk found time to give them
sepulture) in a hastily dug and shallow grave.  In
the meantime the defunct ones were wont to be
dumped down on a rude bier and left there,
sometimes for a whole day, under the fierce rays of a
mid-June sun.  Mianeh was as uncomfortable for
the dead as it was unhealthy for the living.  Truly,
few Persians seem to possess any olfactory sensitiveness.
They would pass the Potter's Field hourly,
showing no concern at the repulsiveness that must
have assailed their eyes and noses.
</p>

<p>
News filtered down the road from Tabriz that the
Turks there were displaying great activity.  They
were daily being reinforced, and made no secret of
their intention to attempt, when sufficiently strong,
the task of chasing the British from Azerbaijan.
They established posts on the Tabriz road southwards
as far as Haji Agha, about sixty miles from
Mianeh.
</p>

<p>
The answer to all these Turkish preparations for
breaking our slender hold upon Azerbaijan was for
Wagstaff urgently to ask for reinforcements and
especially mountain guns.  In the meantime he sent
Osborne back up the Tabriz road, with all the fighting
men that could be spared, to watch the enemy and
to attempt to prevent his breaking farther south.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
Osborne's chief reliance was placed on the few British
N.C.O.'s who accompanied him.  Beyond these, all
he had to stem any Turkish advance was about half
a squadron of newly enrolled irregular horse and a
couple of platoons of native levies who had been
taught the rudiments of musketry and elementary
drill.
</p>

<p>
Their appearance, at all events, was very warlike,
not to say terror-inspiring, and, like some of the
wild tribes of Polynesia, they relied chiefly on the
effectiveness of their make-up when on the
"war-path" to bring about the discomfiture of their
enemies.  The Sowars were unusually awe-inspiring,
hung about as each was with two or three bandoliers
studded with cartridges.  Each carried a rifle, a
sword of antique design, and a short stabbing blade.
</p>

<p>
The Naib, or Lieutenant, who commanded them,
was equally formidable from the point of view of
arms and equipment.  He had a Tulwar shaped like
a reaping-hook, and a Mauser pistol, the butt of
which was inlaid with silver.
</p>

<p>
The tactics of the Sowar levies were something in
the nature of a compromise between a "Wild West"
show and <i>opéra bouffe</i>.  They would gallop at full
speed up a steep hill, brandishing their rifles over
their heads and yelling fiercely the while.  It was
always a fine spectacular display with a dash of
Earl's Court realism thrown in.  The rifles of the
Sowars had a habit of going off indiscriminately
during these moments of tense excitement when they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
were riding down an imaginary and fleeing enemy,
and the British officers who watched their antics
found it expedient in the interests of a whole skin
to remain at a respectful distance from the
manoeuvring, or&mdash;should one say, performing?&mdash;Sowars.
</p>

<p>
Swagger and braggadocio were the principal fighting
stock-in-trade of the levies and their Persian
officers.  They were always clamouring to be led
without delay against the Turks in order that we
might have an opportunity of witnessing what deeds
of valour they would perform under enemy fire.
The time did come, and our brave auxiliaries found
themselves in the front line with a Turkish battalion
about to pay them a morning call&mdash;and we realized
more fully than ever that the hundred-years-old
dictum of that incomparable humorist, Hadji Baba,
still held good, "O Allah, Allah, if there were no
dying in the case, how the Persians would fight!"
</p>

<p>
The Turks having outstripped us in the race to
Tabriz, a belated attempt was made early in July
to get in touch with the sorely pressed Jelus in
Urumia and stretch out to them a succouring hand.
They had sent us a despairing appeal for help.  Their
ammunition was running out; their available supplies
were nearly exhausted; and they were on the verge
of a military collapse.  The Turks threatening Urumia
had offered terms if the Jelus laid down their arms,
but, fearing treachery if they accepted, the War
Council of the Jelus refused the enemy offer,
advising unabated resistance, and urging that an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
attempt should be made by the whole army to break
out towards the south and march in the direction
of Bijar and Hamadan, in order that they might
find safety behind the British lines.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Pennington, a youthful Afrikander
airman who was noted for his coolness and daring,
was despatched from Kasvin on July 7th.  He was
to fly to Urumia carrying a written assurance of
speedy British aid for the beleaguered garrison there.
Pennington made a rapid non-stop flight to Mianeh,
covering the distance from Kasvin in a little over
two hours.  He spent a day at Mianeh, where he
carried out a series of useful demonstrations intended
to impress the local Democrats.  They had never
seen an aeroplane before, and were rather vague as
to its offensive potentialities.  Moreover, they had
been inclined to be scornful of our want of military
strength so glaringly revealed at Mianeh.  But now,
at all events, the Democrats were duly impressed by
Pennington and his machine.  They argued that, if
one aeroplane could come from Kasvin in a couple
of hours, so could a whole flotilla, and armed with
death-dealing bombs.  Not altogether ignorant of
the doctrine of consequences, the Democrats realized
the value of oratorical discretion; so for a while they
put a curb on their poisonously anti-British tongues.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Pennington continued his aerial journey
to Turkish-menaced Urumia, the city by the lake
shore, where a Christian army was sheltering and
wondering anxiously whether it was succour or the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
sword that awaited it.  Within two hours of leaving
Mianeh, the intrepid airman was crossing over Lake
Urumia heading for the western shore.  He dropped
low on approaching the city itself, and his unexpected
appearance brought consternation to the inhabitants.
Aeroplanes were unknown in those parts.  They felt
that this visitor from the clouds could hardly be a
friend; therefore he was presumably a foe.  Reasoning
thus, the Jelus lost no time in blazing away a
portion of their already slender stock of ammunition
in the hope of bringing him down.  The aviator
had many narrow escapes, and so had his machine.
He landed with a few bullet holes through his clothing,
but his aeroplane, happily, had not been "hulled,"
or he would have been immobilized at Urumia.
</p>

<p>
As he alighted, the Jelus rushed up to finish him
off, for they were not noted for being over-merciful
to Turks falling into their hands.  But seeing that
he was English, they embraced him as a preliminary,
and then carried him shoulder-high into the city.
He was the hero of the hour.  The people were
delirious with joy, and women crowded round and
insisted on kissing the much-embarrassed aviator.
As the weather was very hot, Pennington was wearing
the regulation khaki shorts.  One Nestorian woman,
after gazing compassionately at the airman's bare,
sunburnt legs, and noting the brevity of his nether
garment, shook her head sadly and said she had not
realized till then that the British, too, were feeling
the effects of the War and were suffering from a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
shortage of clothing material.  There was a whispered
consultation with some sister-Nestorians, and a
committee was formed to remedy the shortcomings
of Pennington's kit.  The women ripped loose their
own skirts and, arming themselves with needles and
cotton, pleaded to be allowed to fashion complete
trousers for the aviator, or at least to be permitted
to elongate by a yard or so the pair of unmentionables
he was wearing.  The youth blushed furiously, and
was at great pains to explain that there was still
khaki in England, and that it was convenience, and
not any scarcity of material, that had caused the
ends of his trousers to shrink well above his knees.
</p>

<p>
Pennington flew back from Urumia, and it was
arranged that the Jelus with their women and children
were to march south by way of Ushnu and Sain
Kaleh to meet a British relieving force moving up
from Hamadan and Bijar.
</p>

<p>
Early in August Osborne had several brushes with
the Turks on the Tabriz road.  The enemy flooded
our lines with spies, chiefly Persians from Tabriz,
and pushed reconnoitring patrols as far south as
Haji Agha, forty miles from Tabriz.  In these road
skirmishes our Persian levies behaved with their
characteristic unsteadiness.  Once they were fired
upon by hidden infantry at seven hundred yards,
they forgot their promised display of valour, their
courage oozed out at their boots, and they promptly
bolted.  An aerial reconnaissance revealed detachments
of cavalry, artillery, and infantry marching
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
south along the Tabriz road, but Headquarters in
Bagdad refused to attach any importance to this
concentration, and for the moment were deaf to
Wagstaff's reiterated demand for reinforcements, and
especially for a mountain gun or two.
</p>

<p>
Captain Osborne and his party now dug themselves
in at Tikmadash, about fifty miles from Mianeh and
a corresponding distance from Tabriz, and fixed his
headquarters in a serai close to the village which
commanded the Tabriz road.  There was a supporting
British post at Karachaman not far from the
main Tabriz road and fourteen miles to the south-east.
</p>

<p>
Wagstaff's repeated pleadings with "high authority"
at last began to bear fruit.  It was a generally
accepted military axiom out in Mesopotamia and
Persia that, if you were insistent enough in your
demands for an extra platoon or two, with a gun
or an aeroplane thrown in, you were either given the
goods, or dubbed a "flannel-footed fool" and relegated
to the cold shades of official oblivion.  It was
generally the latter.  When Wagstaff, therefore,
heard that he had been given a whole squadron of
14th Hussars, a platoon of the 14th Hants, and a
platoon of Ghurkas, as well as a section of a howitzer
battery and a couple of mountain guns, his habitual
soldierly calm deserted him, and he almost wept for
joy on the neck of his adjutant, debonair "Bobby"
Roberts of the 4th Devons.
</p>

<p>
"C" squadron of the 14th Hussars had made a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
forced march from Kasvin.  Its ranks had been
thinned by fever, and it barely mustered eighty sabres
when it rode over the Kuflan Kuh Pass to Mianeh.
It had but two officers, Lieutenants Jones and
Sweeney, fit for service.  But there was no respite.
Fever-racked troopers and leg-weary horses, after
a night's halt at Mianeh, started on a fifty-mile march
to Tikmadash, where a handful of British were
holding up a Turkish force already numbering nearly
a thousand and growing daily.  The tired infantry
who had "legged it" all the way from Kasvin were
also pushed north in the wake of the cavalry.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Turks came against Osborne at Tikmadash on
September 5th.  For days previously they had been
carefully preparing for the attack.
</p>

<p>
Overnight they sent into the village, unperceived
by the British, an infantry detachment which
fraternized with the inhabitants and also with a small
party of our irregulars who were on observation
duty there.  The treacherous irregulars said nothing
of the presence of the Turks in their midst, and
made common cause with them at once.  Towards
midnight the Turks smuggled in a machine-gun,
which they subsequently mounted on the flat roof
of the dwelling of a Persian official.  At daylight
the Turks, from cover of the village itself, opened a
violent machine-gun fire on the headquarters of
Osborne, which were in a serai a short distance on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
the Mianeh side of Tikmadash village.  All the
officers, some eight or ten in number, lived here.
There were two doors to the serai on two different
sides of the building.  Both these exits were sprayed
with machine-gun fire.  There was nothing for it
but to open the door and run the gauntlet.  It was
like coming within the vortex of a hail-storm, yet,
surprising to relate, few were hit.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the weak units of the 14th Hussars, the
Hants, and the Ghurkas, Osborne had nothing to
depend upon in this critical hour save levies recruited
in Mianeh and elsewhere who, in spite of their boastings,
were always fire-shy.  They took up a position
this morning at Tikmadash, but it was clear from
the beginning that their hearts were not in the
business.
</p>

<p>
After firing some shrapnel into the position, the
Turks stormed it with two thousand infantry.  The
shell fire had already stampeded the Persians, but
their British officers, Captains Heathcote, Amory,
and Trott of the Devons, and Hooper of the Royal
West Kents, by dint of persuasion and threats,
temporarily stopped the disorderly flight, and
induced the wavering men to follow them back into
the line.  But a few more shells from the Turkish
gun, which burst with telling accuracy, finished the
resistance of the levies.  Osborne had no artillery,
the mountain battery section from Mianeh not having
yet arrived.
</p>

<p>
This time the portion of the line held by the levies
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
doubled up like a piece of paper.  Panic seized them,
and they fled with all the swiftness of hunted animals,
throwing away their rifles as they ran.  The Hants,
Ghurkas, and Hussars were now all that was left
to cover the retirement.  The Turks were working
round both flanks and, had the British hung on, the
whole force would have been surrounded and killed
or captured.  Some of the British soldiers were so
incensed at the cowardice of the Persians that they
turned their rifles against the fugitives and shot
them in their tracks.
</p>

<p>
When a retirement was seen to be inevitable, the
charvadars were ordered to load up the stores and
medical supplies at the serai.  In the midst of their
preparations the levies broke and fled.  This decided
the charvadars, who showed themselves to be as
arrant cowards as the rest of their race.  Cutting
away the lashings securing the loads on the transport
mules, they jumped on the animals' backs and
galloped panic-stricken to the rear.
</p>

<p>
Captain John, of the Indian Medical Service, who
had worked like a Trojan attending to the wounded
under fire, now collected three or four British
N.C.O's. and sought to rally the runaway charvadars, or at
least to recapture some of the transport mules.  As
well might Dame Partington have tried to mop back
the waves of the Atlantic.  John, however, did
succeed in moving the British wounded, but all the
officers' kits, medical supplies, and ammunition fell
into the hands of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
</p>

<p>
The sadly diminished and battered British force
withdrew to Karachaman, preceded by the fleeing
native levies, who magnified the extent of our reverse,
and as they ran spread panic amongst the villages
on our line of retreat.
</p>

<p>
Eight days before the Turks hit us at Tikmadash,
news had filtered through to Mianeh that the enemy
was becoming active in Eastern Azerbaijan.  Raiding
parties of Turkish cavalry had penetrated to Sarab,
eighty miles east of Tabriz, and stray bands of tribal
levies who had taken service under the Turkish flag
were reported farther east towards Ardabil and the
Caspian littoral.  They distributed proclamations
broadcast announcing a Jehad or Holy War against
the British, and calling upon the people to rally to
the banner of the Ittahad-i-Islam, or Pan-Islamic
movement, and so make an end of the Infidel occupation
of Persia.  The hapless villagers themselves had
little choice in the matter; compulsion was drastically
applied, and a village that showed hesitation, or
evinced any apathy in embracing the tenets of
the political-cum-religious and Turkish-controlled
Ittahad-i-Islam, was laid waste, its inhabitants
maltreated, or sometimes put to the sword.
</p>

<p>
The Turks further showed their contempt for
Persian authority by seizing the telegraph office at
Sarab and kicking out the detachment of Persian
Cossacks who held the place in the name of the Shah
and did police duty in the district.  These Cossacks,
in common with the rest of their brigade, were under
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
the command of a Russian officer.  He evidently
harboured some extraordinary view as to his duty
towards the Shah's Government, for he accepted with
meek submissiveness the imperative orders of the
Turks to take himself and his command out of
Eastern Azerbaijan without any unnecessary delay.
The Persian Cossacks, the "paid protectors of the
poor," to give them one of their official designations,
rarely "protected" anybody unless as a financial
investment, and their brutality and greed for illicit
gain caused them to be as much dreaded by the
Persian peasant and bazaar shopkeeper as were those
brutal, plundering ruffians, the Turkish Bashi-bazouks
whom the senior partner in the Pan-Islamic firm
had let loose in upper Azerbaijan.
</p>

<p>
To counteract enemy activity round Sarab and
Ardabil a small mounted force was despatched from
our post at Karachaman under Captain Basil
Cochrane of the 13th Hussars.  Cochrane had with him
about forty British enlisted Sowars of Khalkhal
Shahsavans.  Moving across the mountains, he boldly
rode into Sarab.  The Turks, assuming his to be
but the advance guard of a large British force,
scattered at his approach.  The Governor and the
townsfolk welcomed him effusively, and promised
him military support.  But Persian promises are not
always redeemable, as we had already found to our
cost.  Turkish cavalry were advancing afresh and
threatening his rear, so Cochrane, who was fifty
miles as the crow flies from the nearest British post,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
had to let go his hold on Sarab, and retire towards
the south.  Then a veil of silence enshrouded his
movements; and at Mianeh headquarters it was
feared that he had been cut off and killed with his
whole party.
</p>

<p>
I had just come back from a long trek, and had
stretched my weary self out on a camp bed and gone
fast to sleep, booted and spurred, when someone
shook me vigorously.  I awoke and found it was
Wagstaff, chief of the Mission, with orders for me
to take out a mounted party and go in search of
Cochrane.  I mustered the available Sowars of the
station, about fifty in all.  They were recruited from
the Shahsavan tribesmen, and we had had hitherto
no reason to suspect their fidelity.  But immediately
they divined that trouble was brewing and that
they might get a "dusting" from the Turk, they
decided that Mianeh was a healthier place than Sarab,
and mutinied to a man.  Neither threats nor
persuasion could move them.  Having, so to speak,
thrown in their hands, they dismounted from their
shaggy, fleet-footed hill ponies, and stood sullenly
with folded arms, refusing obedience to all orders.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Wagstaff to deal with the mutinous Sowars,
I collected about a dozen of my own Persian police,
and with these and two British N.C.O's., Sergeants
Calthorpe, R.F.A., and Saunders of the 13th Hussars,
set off on my mission.
</p>

<p>
We marched the greater part of the night, and
early next day reached Turkmanchai on the Tabriz
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
road, twenty-five miles north-west of Mianeh.  Here
I impressed ten Sowars of ours who, feigning illness
and suffering from "fire-shyness," had stolen out
of the trenches at Tikmadash.  Our route from
Turkmanchai lay nearly due north towards the
foothills of the lofty Bazgush Range and the country
of the Khalkhal sub-tribe of Shahsavans.  We
bivouacked for the night in the prosperous village
called Benik Suma, which stands in the middle of an
arboreal-cloistered dale watered by a shallow but
swift-running mountain stream.  Supplies were
plentiful, and the hand of famine had not touched this
secluded Persian hamlet, which nestled so cosily
beneath the glorious foliage of oak and chestnut.
</p>

<p>
When the march was resumed in the morning, it
was found that four of the "malingerers" from
Turkmanchai had deserted overnight.  My little
command did not seem at all easy in its mind at the
prospect of having a brush with the enemy, and every
hour that brought us nearer to the hill country an
increasing number of Sowars reported sick and begged
to be allowed to fall out.
</p>

<p>
At first I was puzzled by the spread of this sudden
malady, for the symptoms were identical in each
case&mdash;severe abdominal pains; but presently the
mystery was explained.  I encountered on the road
a Persian Cossack who had ridden in from the Sarab
district, and had come across the mountains that
lay ahead of us.  He volunteered the information
that in a village about twenty miles distant he had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
seen a Turkish cavalry patrol.  Our Sowars on
hearing this looked very glum, and four of them at
once complained of violent illness.  They rolled on
the ground in pretended agony, artfully simulating
an acute cholera seizure.  This time, and without
much difficulty, I diagnosed the disease as being
that of pure funk, or what is commonly known in
military parlance as "cold feet."  While sympathizing
with the sufferers, I gravely told them that
I had instructions to shoot off-hand any of my
command who became cholera-stricken, and to burn their
bodies in order to prevent the disease spreading.
The result was little short of magical.  The "severe
pains" disappeared, and the patients made such a
wonderful recovery that within half an hour they
were able to mount their horses and turn their faces
towards Sarab once more.  And the "epidemic" did
not reappear.
</p>

<p>
We entered the mouth of the gloomy Chachagli
Pass in the Bazgush Range.  Horsemen afar off had
hovered on our flanks and reconnoitred us carefully,
but the distance was too great to tell whether they
were enemy irregulars or simply roving Shahsavans
in search of plunder, who would impartially despoil,
provided the chances were equal, Briton, Turk, or
Persian.
</p>

<p>
The Chachagli Pass, a trifle over 8,000 feet, must
surely be the most difficult to negotiate in the whole
of the Middle East.  The road or track from the
southern entrance of the Pass follows a narrow
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
valley shut in by a high gorge.  A huge mass of
limestone rock, parting company with some parent
outcrop several thousand feet above our heads, has
fallen bodily into the shallow stream which rushes
down the Pass, damming up its waters momentarily.
The stream is angry, but not baffled, at this clumsy
effort to bar its path.  Gathering volume and
strength, and mounting on the back of the impeding
boulder, it dives off its smooth surface with all the
energy and vim of a miniature Niagara, and goes on
its way humming a merry note of rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
After traversing the stream repeatedly, the road
tilts its nose in the air and mounts sharply.  With
just enough room for sober-going mules to pass in
single file, it skirts the brink of a precipice until the
top is reached.  The rocks radiated a torrid heat
that September morning, and the sun struck across
our upward path.  It was difficult climbing, for there
is not in all the Chachagli Pass enough tree shade to
screen a mountain goat.
</p>

<p>
On the north side of the summit the road descends
just as abruptly; the track is narrow and rugged,
and it requires careful going to avoid toppling over
the unramped side and down into the rock-studded
bed of the stream.
</p>

<p>
It was nearing sunset on the evening of September
2nd, and my small force was preparing to bivouac
for the night, when two Sowars who had been foraging
in a village to the west came galloping with news of
the enemy.  They had learned that a party of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
Turkish irregulars had halted in a hamlet three
miles away.
</p>

<p>
We moved in the direction indicated and found
the information was correct.  The enemy horsemen,
believing themselves secure, had neglected to mount
a guard.  They had off-saddled and were sleeping
peacefully in the shade of a mud-walled compound
when we burst into the place and surprised them.
They were ten in all.  Rudely disturbed in their
siesta, they surrendered without firing a shot.  The
prisoners comprised two Turkish N.C.O's., six Sowars,
and two agents of the Ittahad-i-Islam.  They had
evidently been "billposting" and recruiting, for their
saddlebags contained letters addressed to Turkish
sympathizers in the district and also the red armlets
worn as a distinguishing badge by the newly enrolled
fedais who undertook to fight under the crescent-flag
of the Osmanli.
</p>

<p>
My own Sowars were greatly elated over this minor
success.  Their spirits rose accordingly, and they
now professed to regard the fighting Turk with
disdain, and to be prepared to match themselves
single-handed against a whole troop of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
But it was all mere bombast.  The prisoners were
sent down to Mianeh with an escort of six of these
"valorous" levies.  On the way they, though, of
course, unarmed, overpowered the guard, took the
arms and horses, and escaped.
</p>

<p>
At daylight next morning, September 3rd, the
march northwards was resumed.  Our advanced
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
guard was fired upon by some armed horsemen, who
retired.  Following them up, we found that they
were some of Cochrane's scouts who had mistaken
us for Turks.  Cochrane himself I came across two
hours later.  With his little force he had retreated
without loss from Sarab, and had taken up a snug
defensive position on the brow of a wooded eminence,
where he placidly awaited whatever fate might send
him first&mdash;the attacking Turk, or the succouring
British.
</p>

<p>
The tribesmen were friendly towards us, and,
attracted by the prospect of good pay, were offering
themselves freely as recruits.  Making due allowance
for the fighting instability of our levies, we felt we
were strong enough to hold on, and if the worst came
to the worst, and we were outnumbered, capable of
putting up a running fight with the enemy.
</p>

<p>
But the end bordered on the dramatic, and came
with an abruptness that neither of us had foreseen.
As related in a previous chapter, Osborne was heavily
attacked at Tikmadash on the morning of September
5th, and the news of his retreat and the advance
of the Turks along the Tabriz road did not reach
Cochrane and myself until 2 a.m. on the morning of
the 6th.  It was a ticklish situation.  Go forward
we could not, and our only way back was over the
gloomy fastness of the Chachagli Pass.  The Turks,
we knew, were advancing rapidly, and we mentally
saw them already astride our one line of retreat and
ourselves trapped at the south exit of the Pass.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
</p>

<p>
There was no time to be lost.  So, destroying our
surplus stores, and with grim faces, we set off in the
darkness of the night.  Our levies surmised that
something had gone wrong with the British, and fear
gripped their hearts.  They deserted wholesale and
without waiting to bid us adieu.  There was a picket
of fifteen Persians and a British sergeant in a village
a mile to our front.  The sergeant alone reported
back.  His command had "hopped it" when they
realized that danger threatened.  Five miles behind
us on the crest of the ridge there was an observation
post of thirty irregulars with a Naib or native
lieutenant and two British N.C.O's.  The Naib had the
previous evening vaunted his personal prowess, and
assured Cochrane and myself that no Turks would
pass that way except over his lifeless body.  But
when we reached his post in the blackness of the
night, we discovered that the gallant Naib had fled
none knew whither, and taken all his men with him.
We never saw him again.  The two N.C.O's. had
mounted guard alternately, and we found them
cursing Persian irregulars and Persian perfidy with
a degree of vigour and a candour that did adequate
justice to their own private view of the situation.
</p>

<p>
Cochrane is an Afrikander born, and as resourceful
and plucky a soldier as ever donned khaki.  Used
to night marching on the veldt, he led the advanced
guard of our party through the intricate, labyrinthian
windings of the Chachagli Pass where a single false
step meant death.  It was nerve-straining work, this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
night march in the darkness, with men, horses, and
transport mules following each other in blind
procession and groping for a foothold on the narrow
causeway.  That mysterious dread of the unseen
and the unknown, ever present on such occasions as
these, clutched with a tenfold force the timorous
hearts of the native levies who had survived the
earlier stampede at the beginning of the retreat.
Their teeth chattered, and their trembling fingers
were always inadvertently pressing triggers of loaded
rifles, which kept popping off and heightening the
nerve tension.
</p>

<p>
We got clear of the Pass shortly after daylight.
Fortunately the Turks were not there to intercept
our march.  With the passing of the long night vigil,
and the coming of the dawn, gloom was dispelled;
life assumed a rosier tint, and the levies recovered
some of their lost spirits and waning courage.  Once
free of the imprisoning hills, and out on the broad
plateau that dipped southwards to intersect the
Tabriz road, we headed straight for Turkmanchai.
Once we rode into a village as fifty well-mounted
horsemen, disturbed like a covey of frightened birds,
bolted out at the other end.  We found that they
were Shahsavan robbers, who looked upon our party
as potential enemies.  Turkish cavalry in extended
order were visible on the skyline as we gained the
shelter of Turkmanchai.
</p>

<p>
We reached this spot in the nick of time.  Osborne's
force had been compelled to evacuate Karachaman,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
the position occupied after Tikmadash, and his
sorely pressed command was now trickling into
Turkmanchai with the Turks at their heels.  Turkmanchai
village is at the base of a steep hill.  At its
summit the road from Tabriz squeezes through a
narrow-necked pass.  Here the Hants and the
Ghurkas took up a position in order to arrest the
Turkish advance.  A section of a mountain battery
had arrived overnight.  The Turkish cavalry
appeared in column of route, out of rifle fire as yet,
and blissfully ignorant of our possession of artillery.
The cavalry made an admirable target.  Two well-directed
shells burst in the midst of the astonished
horsemen.  Their surprise was complete, and wheeling
they opened out and galloped wildly for cover.  The
impromptu salvo of artillery set them thinking, and
they did not trouble us again that day.
</p>

<p>
To hold Turkmanchai was impossible.  We had
stopped the Turks in front, but they were working
round our flanks, and it was only a question of hours
when we should be isolated and cut off from Mianeh.
We were outnumbered by fully ten to one, and the
flanking parties of cavalry which the enemy threw
out were alone larger than the British combined
force of regulars and irregulars.
</p>

<p>
A fresh retirement was decided upon, and on the
morning of September 7th we evacuated Turkmanchai.
The wounded and the sick were removed
in transport carts, and two hours after midnight the
head of the column moved slowly off in the darkness.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
I was in charge of the advanced guard, and found
myself in command of a varied assortment of Persian
irregulars, some of whom had "distinguished"
themselves at Tikmadash and Karachaman and had been
"rounded up" by British troops during the retreat.
They were a motley crew, and what infinitesimal
amount of pluck they ever possessed had long ago
evaporated.  In the advanced guard it was difficult
to restrain their impetuosity.  They dashed off at
top speed as if they were riding a fifty-mile Derby
race to Mianeh.  But their one impelling motive
was to place as many miles as possible of dusty road
between themselves and the oncoming Turks before
daylight.
</p>

<p>
By dint of threats of summary punishment they
were brought to heel and ultimately held in leash.
Silence it was impossible to impose, short of some
form of gagging, and they chattered like a cageful
of monkeys, utterly heedless of the danger of
betraying our presence to the enemy.  Then, too, their
superheated imagination saw Turks growing on
every bush.  "Osmani anja!"  "Osmani anja!"
(The Turks are there!) they would cry, indicating
some village donkey or goat taking a hillside stroll.
Fortunately for us, the Turks showed themselves to
be singularly lacking in energy, and were not keen
on risking a night attack in unknown country, or
they might have ambushed the advanced guard half
a dozen times before it got clear of the danger zone.
With our Persian "braves" to rely upon, there
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
would surely have been a "regrettable incident" to
record officially.
</p>

<p>
The Turks waited for daylight, and then they
attacked the main body and the rearguard, but were
beaten off, and the column extricating itself reached
Mianeh in safety.

CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
EVACUATION OF MIANEH
</h3>

<p class="intro">
We have a chilly reception&mdash;Our popularity wanes&mdash;Preparation
for further retirement&mdash;Back to the Kuflan Kuh Pass&mdash;Our
defensive position&mdash;Turks make a frontal attack&mdash;Our line
overrun&mdash;Gallantry of Hants and Worcesters&mdash;Pursuit by

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mianeh, pampered, spoon-fed Mianeh, which had
grown fat on British bread and comparatively wealthy
on British money, gave the retreating column a
chilly reception.
</p>

<p>
The bazaar looked at us askance, and the Democrats
spat meaningly in our direction and muttered
a malediction upon our heads.  There was joy in the
eyes of the people which they took no pains to
conceal.
</p>

<p>
The news of the Turkish success, much magnified
in passing from mouth to mouth and village to
village, had preceded our arrival, and the barometer
of bazaar sentiment, always a sure gauge of Persian
public opinion, had veered round to "stormy."
</p>

<p>
And "stormy" it was to be.  It was felt that
the sands of the British glass had run out.  The
attitude of the people underwent a sudden change
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
from cringing supplication to one of thinly veiled
hostility.  Fawning officials, who had battened upon
our liberality and profited by our largesse, now fell
over themselves in their efforts to sponge the slate
clean and write upon it a Persian improvised version
of the "Hymn of Hate."  They threw the full
weight of their mean souls into the job.  In the
bazaar they buzzed about like so many poisonous
gadflies, and in order to curry favour with their new
masters-to-be they incited the people to anti-British
demonstrations, and beat and imprisoned humble
folk whose friendship for our nation was disinterested
and had not been offered on the local commercial
basis of so many krans per pound.  With one exception,
all the district notables&mdash;who had always been
reiterating their professions of friendship, and to
whom we had paid large sums as subsidies for faithless,
turn-tail levies, or as purchase price for grain&mdash;went
over to the enemy.  Our Mianeh police, my
own command, or those of them who were Persians,
followed the general example and ran off to join the
Turks.
</p>

<p>
There was one notable exception.  Four Kurds
who belonged to the police and who could not be
intimidated or cajoled, stood firm and refused to be
carried off by the wave of desertion, and they
remained to guard the Mission premises.
</p>

<p>
After Turkmanchai we did not tarry long in
Mianeh.  Preparations were at once made for a
further retirement.  The Turks were coming on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
slowly and methodically, and apparently in no
immediate hurry to hustle us out of Mianeh.  The
long and, in a sense, rapid marches of the previous
five days during hot weather had told upon the
Turkish infantry, and now the advancing enemy had
cried a halt in order that his tired troops might enjoy
a brief repose.
</p>

<p>
Our next defensive position was the Kuflan Kuh
or Qaplan Kuh (the panthers' hill) Pass, which lies
five miles south-east of Mianeh.  The main range
of the Kuflan Kuh runs roughly from east to west,
and the Tabriz-Zinjan road passes over its crest at a
height of about five thousand feet.  At the end of the
Mianeh plain, and some two miles from the village
itself, there is a solid brick bridge over the Karangu
River.  Once the river is crossed, coming from
Mianeh, the rise begins gradually, and the foothills
of the Pass are met with a mile or so from the river
bank.  The ascent from the northern or Mianeh end
is very difficult, and the road mounts between two
perpendicular walls of rock.  The gradient is steep,
and the outer edge of the roadway was wholly
unprotected until a British labour corps took the job
on hand and interposed a coping-stone barrier between
the exposed side of the road and the abyss below.
The same workers also plugged up some of the gaping
holes in the roadway which had existed from time
immemorial.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday, September 8th, the whole of Major
Wagstaff's force bade farewell without regret to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
Mianeh, marched across the Karangu, and placed the
formidable barrier of the Kuflan Kuh between itself
and the advancing enemy.  Wagstaff established his
headquarters in a ruined caravanserai near the stone
bridge which spans the Kizil Uzun River at the
southern entrance to the Pass.  All the stores of
wheat and barley which had been accumulating in
Mianeh were destroyed before evacuation, and the
rearguard crossed the Karangu without molestation
either from the Turks or from their new allies, the
Mianehites, who were hourly showing themselves
more hostile to the retiring British.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-190"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-190.jpg" alt="NORTH GATE, KASVIN." />
<br />
NORTH GATE, KASVIN.
</p>

<p>
Headquarters at Kasvin now began to be alarmed
at the uninterrupted southward advance of the Turks,
for, if Zinjan fell, Kasvin might be expected to follow,
and our line of communications from Hamadan
towards the Caspian would be cut.  General Dunsterville
himself was away in Baku, fighting Bolsheviks
and Turks.  Some weeks earlier, with the help of
Bicherakoff and his Russians, he had rooted out
Kuchik Khan from his jungle fastness, and opened
the road from Manjil to Resht and the Caspian
Sea.
</p>

<p>
Wagstaff was accordingly ordered to hold the Kuflan
Kuh at all costs, but what he was to hold it with
was not quite clear, inasmuch as his total dependable
fighting strength of Hants, Ghurkas, and 14th
Hussars did not exceed 250 bayonets and 50 sabres,
the few remaining levies being a negligible quantity.
He had been given a machine-gun detachment, a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
mountain battery section, two field guns, and a
howitzer.  His main position was on a line of low
hills extending for about three miles below the
northern face of the Pass, and commanding the
approaches from the Mianeh plain and the brick
bridge across the Karangu.  The guns were on the
reverse or southern slope of the Pass, whence by
indirect fire they could make it unpleasant for an
enemy crossing the Karangu bridge or fording the
shallow river itself.
</p>

<p>
A platoon of the Worcesters arrived to reinforce
our attenuated line, and Colonel Matthews of the
14th Hants took over command on the 9th.  The
Turks had now occupied Mianeh in force, and during
the ensuing two days were busy preparing for an
offensive movement.  They pushed a considerable
body of infantry down to the cultivated fields
bordering the north bank of the Karangu.  Here, amongst
the boundary ditches, topped with low bushes, they
found a certain amount of ready-made cover, and
they subjected our advanced posts on the right to a
harassing fire.  These were held by levies with a
stiffening of British officers and British N.C.O's.
The Persians, as usual, became "jumpy" whenever
Turkish bullets hummed in their immediate vicinity,
and as they were utterly lacking in elementary
fire-control they were a source of vexatious perplexity
to their British officers and sergeants.  One officer,
in despair at their utter unreliability under fire,
pleadingly suggested that they might be withdrawn
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
altogether, and himself left with two British sergeants
to hold the post.
</p>

<p>
Even after making due allowance for the complete
worthlessness of our Persian auxiliaries, we hesitated
to believe that the Turks would commit themselves
to a frontal attack on the Kuflan Kuh.  Given a
sufficiency of reliable troops, it would have been an
admirably strong defensive position, and any enemy
who came "butting" against it with lowered head
would have found the experiment a costly one.
</p>

<p>
But the Turks had seemingly gauged the measure
of our strength and our weakness more accurately
than we had ourselves, for, eschewing anything in
the nature of new-fangled turning movements, they
came at us in the good old-fashioned way, and by the
most direct route.
</p>

<p>
The attack was delivered after breakfast on
September 12th, and on the part of the enemy
there was no sign of hurry or confusion.  Two
thousand infantry, highly trained and admirably
handled, belonging to one of their crack Caucasian
divisions, crossed the river in extended order and
flung themselves against our line.  The shock of
contact was first felt on the right, where the Persians
were in position.  These latter promptly broke and
fled in utter disorder, all attempts to rally them
proving futile.  Our line was now in the air, so to
speak, with the Persians scuttling like rabbits up
towards the entrance to the Pass.  It was short and
bloody work.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Hants and the Ghurkas had now to bear the
brunt of the attack.  The Turks, reinforced, came
on in surging waves and flowed over their trenches.
Both units made a gallant but ineffectual fight, and
were forced back up the Pass, suffering considerable
losses.  The enemy followed up his advantage and
stormed the Pass itself.  A last stand was made at
the summit to cover the retreat of the guns.  Here
Hants and Turks fought hand to hand with bayonet
and clubbed rifle, until the sadly diminished remnant
of this brave battalion, after losing their gallant
sergeant-major, were literally pushed over the crest
and down the reverse slope.  But they had stood their
ground long enough to save the guns from capture.
</p>

<p>
The Worcesters, who had been in reserve on the
southern slope, now came doubling into action to
the assistance of the hard-pressed Hants.  Taking
shelter behind the boulders which are plentiful on
both sides of the roadway, they covered the retirement,
driving the Turkish snipers off the summit of
the Pass and arresting any immediate pursuit on the
part of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The caravanserai at the Kizil Uzun Bridge, where
Colonel Matthews had his headquarters, being now
untenable, he withdrew with his remaining force
across the Baleshkent Pass to Jamalabad on the
road to Zinjan.  As for the runaway levies, some
of them did not halt until they had placed a good
twenty miles between themselves and the scene of
the Kuflan Kuh fighting.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Turks pursued us to Jamalabad, but it was
the last kick.  Their offensive spent itself here,
thanks to a new factor which had entered into the
game.  This was the armoured car sections, light
and heavy, under Colonel Crawford and Lieutenant-Colonel
Smiles, which, when our position was indeed
precarious, had been rushed up from Kasvin and
Zinjan in support of our retiring column.  The Turks
got a bad peppering at Jamalabad, and a few miles
farther south at Sarcham where the cars were in
action.  The enemy had no liking for this sort of
fighting, and troubled us no more.  They withdrew
from Jamalabad and, in anticipation of a counter-offensive
on our part, proceeded to fortify themselves
on the Kuflan Kuh.
</p>

<p>
A week after the fight at the Kuflan Kuh two men
of the Hants who had been captured by the Turks
arrived in our lines, clothed in nothing save a
handkerchief apiece.  While their captors were squabbling
amongst themselves as to the distribution of the
worldly possessions of the prisoners, the latter had
slipped away unperceived and gained Jamalabad.
There they were waylaid by Persian thieves, badly
beaten, stripped of their clothing, and left for dead
on the roadside.  Still, they were a plucky pair, for,
recovering, they set out afresh, and, completing a
fifty-mile tramp in the blazing sun without food or
raiment, rejoined their unit.
</p>

<p>
The Crawford armoured cars and the Matthews
column slowly fell back on Zinjan, and there
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
ended the military activities of the Tabriz
expedition.
</p>

<p>
My strictures on the fighting value of the Persian
may appear unduly severe.  I fully realize that one
had no right to expect very much from a mass of
raw, undisciplined material.  The men were hastily
recruited, and their training, necessarily
circumscribed by the exigencies of time, could not have
been anything but perfunctory and imperfect in the
circumstances.  But I am tilting rather at the theory
prevalent in certain quarters at the inception of
the Tabriz Expedition that one had only to send
British officers into the highways and byways of
Azerbaijan and that they would find there "ready-made"
soldiers endowed with a fine fighting spirit,
hardly inferior in quality to our own superb infantry,
men who would stand up to trained and efficient
soldiers like the Turks.  Having once got the half-trained
levies into the trenches, their British officers
were expected to hold them by sheer force of
will-power, and to hypnotize them into taking aim at an
enemy without shutting both eyes.  Now the bubble
of Persian fighting efficiency has been pricked, and
we have a more just appreciation of the virtues and
shortcomings of the Persians as a unit in a modern
army.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
CRUSHING A PLOT
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Anti-British activities&mdash;Headquarters at Hamadan&mdash;Plans to
seize ringleaders&mdash;Midnight arrests&mdash;How the Governor
was entrapped.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Back in Hamadan, the fierce political enmity of the
Democrats, which had been quiet for some time,
broke into fresh activity after the removal of
Dunsterville headquarters to Kasvin at the end of May.
</p>

<p>
General Byron, who was in charge at Hamadan,
speedily discovered through his Intelligence Officers
that the local Democrats were bent on making things
merry for the British, if they possibly could.  Previous
rebuffs had taught the Democrats the value of silence
and a more complete method of organization.  Their
defects in these directions were now to some extent
remedied.  Turkish gold, too, was forthcoming, and
the Democrats of Hamadan became a secret political
organization&mdash;a sort of Persian Mafia or Camorra&mdash;which
was hatching a political conspiracy against the
British.  It was the Ittahad-i-Islam again at work.
This organization, while outwardly making common
cause with the Islamic malcontents of Hamadan
and elsewhere, was in secret working strenuously for
Turkey and the Turkish cause, and the Democrats
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
who were caught in its net were but a means to
that end.
</p>

<p>
One thing, however, soon became clear&mdash;that a vast
network of Turkish espionage, with ramifications
through Persia, had its headquarters in Hamadan.
For many weeks the organization was allowed to
have free rein in the carrying out of its "holy work."
</p>

<p>
Its propaganda mills worked long and late; its
agents came and went; Turkish emissaries slipped
into Hamadan and out again without any difficulty,
and the leaders of the Hamadan movement, which
aimed at our overthrow by a <i>tour de force</i>, must have
often chuckled to themselves at our apparent
simplicity and at the ease with which we had been
outmatched by Oriental cunning.
</p>

<p>
While feigning blindness, the British were very
watchful indeed.  It was like the story of the faithful
retainer of the Samurai noble in feudal Japan who
set out to avenge his lord's death.  His enemies were
powerful and vigilant, but in the end his carefully
simulated indifference threw them completely off
their guard, and he triumphed.  So it was in
Hamadan, where sharp wits were pitted against sharp
wits.  In time the chiefs of the inner ring of the
Hamadan combination grew careless.  Little by
little, their secret signs and passwords, their working
programme, their membership roll, and even full
details of the Turkish system of espionage in Persia
generally, passed into our hands.  There was little
more to wait for.  It was time to strike.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
</p>

<p>
But a fresh difficulty immediately presented itself.
The plotters, in co-operation with Kuchik Khan,
had fixed the date for an armed revolt against British
occupation; and what afterwards happened in Egypt,
was, in June of 1918, deliberately and carefully
planned to take place in Hamadan.  There were
practically no troops in the town at the time, and
the torch of revolt once lighted and the work of our
extermination begun, ten or twelve officers with a
couple of dozen of N.C.O's. of Dunsterforce could
not for long have resisted the determined onslaught
of a fanatical and arrack-incited population of
70,000.
</p>

<p>
To arrest the leaders openly in daylight would
assuredly have precipitated a disaster, and led to
bloodshed, and probably to our own undoing.  The
inner council of the conspiracy consisted of fifteen
members, and included the Persian Governor and a
number of local notables.
</p>

<p>
Secrecy and surprise were essential; so the plan
hit upon was a night descent simultaneously on the
whole band, an officer and two N.C.O's. being detailed
for each arrest.
</p>

<p>
The procedure in the following case may be taken
as typical of the others: In the early hours of the
morning a Persian batman in the employ of a British
officer was directed to deliver a sealed envelope marked
"From O.C. Hamadan" at the house of one of the
plotters.  The messenger, hammering at the door,
aroused the sleepy watchman within, and told him
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
that he had an important letter to deliver from the
British General.  "Come back in the morning,"
would reply the watchman, "my master is in bed
and asleep."  The messenger, duly coached, would
reply, "That is impossible.  Open the door.  The
letter, I know, is important, for I have been given
ten krans to deliver it safely."  The watchman, while
wary and inclined to be suspicious of belated callers,
was also avaricious, and was not going to let slip
any chance of netting a few krans.  As had been
anticipated, his greed overcame his caution.  He
opened the door in order to claim his share of the
late letter delivery fee.  As soon as he did so, a
couple of stalwart British sergeants, springing out
of the darkness, seized, bound, and gagged him.
Once within the high-walled courtyard of the house,
the rest was easy.  It was but a few steps to the
sleeping apartments, and the proscribed conspirator
as a rule woke up to find the chilly muzzle of a British
service revolver pressing against his temple.  He
was gagged to prevent his raising an alarm; his
hands were bound; and, thus helpless, he was carried
off and dumped into a covered motor lorry, where
an armed guard saw that he came to no harm.
</p>

<p>
But the Persian Governor himself was the most
difficult of the whole band to surprise and arrest.
His residence was in a big walled serai at the extreme
end of Hamadan, and, in accordance with Persian
custom, and by reason of his official position, he
lived surrounded by a guard of about fifty men.  To
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
deal with him tact and finesse were necessarily called
into play.
</p>

<p>
The task of securing the Governor quietly and
without unnecessary fuss fell to the lot of a Colonel
who had learned something of native ways in Rhodesia
and East Africa.  He was an Irishman possessing a
glib tongue, a knowledge of Persian, and all the
suavity of his race.  He also had the advantage of
being known to the Governor and his entourage.
So, when he knocked at the door of the Governor's
residence at an hour long after midnight, the
watchman admitted him without hesitation.  The guard
turned out and eyed the intruder suspiciously, but,
finding it was the sartip sahib (Colonel) from the
British Mission who was making inquiries about the
state of the Governor's health, they yawned sleepily
and betook themselves to the shelter of their blankets,
vowing inwardly that the eccentricities of this strange
race called English who paid ceremonious visits in
the middle of the night were beyond the comprehension
of any Oriental mind.
</p>

<p>
"There has come wonderful news from Teheran,
and the Governor must be told at once," said the
visitor, flourishing a big envelope with many red
seals attached thereto.
</p>

<p>
"Good," replied the janitor deferentially, "the
Governor is enjoying sweet repose, but if it is the
wish of the Colonel Sahib, I will take him the paper."
</p>

<p>
"Alas, that it should be so!" interposed the caller
gravely, "but into his own hands alone am I permitted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
to deliver this precious letter.  Go, faithful
one!  Summon your illustrious master, the protector
of the poor, and the friend of the oppressed!  I will
remain on guard by the open door, and none shall
enter in your absence."
</p>

<p>
The ruse succeeded.  The servitor departed on his
errand, and in a few minutes returned with the
Governor clad in a dressing-gown and slippers.  He
greeted the Colonel, who handed him the envelope
which contained a blank sheet of paper.  It was
dark on the threshold where the Governor stood
tearing open the missive, so the Colonel proffered the
aid of his electric torch.  Presently the Governor,
divining that something was amiss, looked up with
a start, and found himself covered with a revolver.
"Come with me," said the officer tersely, "and,
above all, do not resist or attempt to summon help!"  The
trapped official obeyed with docility, and followed
his captor to a waiting automobile, into which
he was bundled and placed in charge of a British
guard.  Two sentries at the guardroom door kept
the Persian guard within in subjection while the
Governor's papers were being seized.  These latter
proved to the hilt his complicity in the plot that
was being hatched to destroy British lives in
Hamadan.  The deposed official&mdash;accompanied by copies
of the incriminating documents&mdash;was sent as a present
to the Teheran Cabinet, with a polite request for
an explanation of the gross treachery of their
unfaithful servant.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
</p>

<p>
The coup had succeeded without the firing of a
shot, and the back of the conspiracy was broken,
for it was left impotent and leaderless.  Before
sunrise all the captives, with the exception of the
Governor, were on their way to Bagdad and an
internment camp.
</p>

<p>
An amusing sidelight on the affair was the attitude
of the Persian police in Hamadan.  Hearing of the
arrests, they assumed the worst.  They bolted,
taking refuge in the neighbouring cornfields, where
they remained a whole day under the impression
that they were the sole survivors of a "general
massacre" of inhabitants carried out by the British.

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In a previous chapter I pointed out that Kuchik
Khan was in military possession of the Manjil-Resht
road, and that the Russians under Bicherakoff
were concentrating at Kasvin preparatory to
trying conclusions with this amiable bandit&mdash;the
cat's-paw of Turkish-German intrigue&mdash;who was
barring Bicherakoff's route to the Caspian and to
Russia.
</p>

<p>
At the end of May, in order to bring about a more
effectual co-operation between his own force and
that of the Russian commander, General Dunsterville
transferred his headquarters from Hamadan to
Kasvin.
</p>

<p>
The original purpose of the Dunsterville Mission,
it will be recollected, was to fight Bolshevism by the
organizing of Armenians and Georgians and, if
possible, Tartars, in the Southern Caucasus.  This
had now become difficult of realization, owing to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
the series of bewildering and kaleidoscopic changes in
Transcaucasia which had profoundly affected the
entire political and military situation.  For example,
the virus of Bolshevism had infected the Russian
troops in Baku; the Germans had landed at Batum
and, by making peace with the Georgians, were
placed in possession of Tiflis.  The Turks had
arranged a peace pact with the Armenians which
left their armies free to invade north-west Persia,
prosecute a vigorous campaign against the Nestorians
of Urumia, and, finally, overrun the Caucasus as a
preliminary to co-operating with the Germans in
their contemplated advance on Baku.  Now the
Bolshevik leaders in Baku refused to recognize the
right of either of the rival belligerent groups&mdash;the
Central Powers or the Entente&mdash;to spoil the flavour
of their military hotch-potch in any way.  It suited
the blasé Russian palate, and that should be sufficient.
The Bolsheviks, at all events, were consistent
to the extent that, while they opposed the advance
of the Germans and Turks towards Baku, they more
than once resolutely refused to accept the proposed
aid of British troops to help them in overcoming the
forces of the Central Powers.

</p>

<p>
Negotiations with Kuchik Khan had ended abortively.
The leader of the Jungalis was quite prepared
to permit Russian troops to withdraw from Persia
if they wished, and to pass through his "occupied
territory" to their port of embarkation on the
Caspian.  But British, "No!"  They had no business
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
in Persia at all, he argued, and if they were
desirous of going to Russia, they would have to find
some other road.
</p>

<p>
The haughty tone of this communication angered
the Russian General, and he sent Kuchik Khan an
ultimatum, calling upon him to evacuate the Manjil
position with all his followers, or be prepared to take
the consequences.  As Kuchik ignored this, a
combined Russian-British force was sent against him on
June 12th.  Two of the British armoured cars which
the year previously had formed part of the
Locker-Lampson unit in Russia proper, were present at the
attack.  After a brief bombardment, a white flag
was hoisted on the Manjil bridge position, and two
German officers issued from the trenches to parley.
They offered, on behalf of Kuchik Khan, to come to
terms with the Russians and allow them to pass,
provided a similar concession was not demanded by
the British.  Bicherakoff's reply was to dismiss the
impudent <i>parliamentaires</i>, and to intimate that
Kuchik Khan and his whole force could have fifteen
minutes in which to lay down their arms and
surrender.  Nothing happened, so at the end of the
stipulated period the advance was ordered, and the
Russians and British stormed the enemy trenches
and speedily disposed of the Jungalis holding them.
Kuchik and a portion of his army, with his two
German military advisers, escaped for the time; but,
after another drubbing had been administered to him,
the crestfallen Jungali leader was glad to make
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
peace, dismiss his German staff officers and drill
instructors and release McLaren and Oakshott, two
Englishmen, who had spent months in captivity.
</p>

<p>
The road to Resht and Enzeli was open at last,
and Bicherakoff moved to the Caspian without delay
and set about embarking his command for Baku.
As a leader, Bicherakoff was popular amongst his
men; and in the Caucasus he enjoyed deserved prestige
as a soldier.  He was pro-Russian&mdash;that is to say,
anti-Bolshevik; and it was felt that his own personal
influence, no less than the presence of his troops at
Baku, would serve as a powerful antidote to
Bolshevik activity in Southern Caucasia.
</p>

<p>
Bicherakoff's contingent embarked at Enzeli on
July 3rd.  A British armoured car battery accompanied
the Russians, and, in order not to ruffle unduly the
susceptibilities of the Bolsheviks, British officers and
men wore Russian uniforms.  But these they
discarded on landing at Baku.  Bicherakoff, who made
a favourable impression locally and was well received
by the inhabitants of the great oil centre, lost no
time in seeking out and engaging the Turks, who
were menacing Baku from two sides.  A good deal
of heavy fighting went on during the middle of July,
and the British armoured cars rendered signal
services, being engaged almost daily in close-quarter
fighting with the Turks, enfilading their infantry and
breaking up their threatened attacks, and, on another
occasion, repulsing a cavalry charge with heavy loss
to the enemy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
</p>

<p>
Bicherakoff, however, soon found that the local
troops were not to be relied on, even when they
professed their readiness to fight under his flag and
against the Turks.  On July 29th the Turks, who
seemed bent on getting possession of Baku at any
cost, succeeded in capturing Adji-Kabul station, a
short distance south-west of Baku.  Using this as
a pivot, they swung northwards in order to complete
the envelopment of Baku.
</p>

<p>
The Russian commander now became anxious for
his own safety.  Realizing his powerlessness to carry
on an effective offensive, and fearing lest he should
be shut up in Baku when the Turkish encircling
movement became complete, he hurriedly abandoned
the town, and with his British armoured car
auxiliaries went off north by rail towards Derbend and
Petrovsk, to operate against the Bolsheviks and
Dageshani Tartars who were terrorizing the country
bordering on the Caspian.
</p>

<p>
In the attack on Petrovsk, the armoured car unit
led under the command of Captain Crossing.  Their
fire threw the Bolshevik troops into confusion, and,
when the latter broke, the cars pursued them through
the town, capturing several hundred of their number.
A battery of six-inch guns which had subjected the
attacking force to an annoying fire was with
extraordinary temerity engaged by the armoured cars
and put out of action by the simple, but dare-devil
expedient of dashing up within range and shooting
all the gunners.  This splendid and heroic deed won
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
for Captain Crossing&mdash;"the super-brave Crossing,"
as Bicherakoff designated him&mdash;the Cross of
St. George, and the Order of St. Vladimir for Lieutenant
Wallace; nor in the distribution of awards for gallantry
were the men who accompanied the two officers in
the armoured car charge against the guns forgotten
by the grateful Russian commander.

CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
THE NEW DASH TO BAKU
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Treachery in the town&mdash;Jungalis attack Resht&mdash;Armoured cars
in street-fighting&mdash;Baku tires of Bolshevism&mdash;British
summoned to the rescue&mdash;Dunsterville sets out&mdash;Position at Baku
on arrival&mdash;British officers' advice ignored&mdash;Turkish

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We were soon to discover that we had not cut the
claws of the Jungali tiger, and that he was yet
capable of giving us serious trouble.
</p>

<p>
There had been a good deal of unrest amongst the
disbanded followers of Kuchik Khan.  Men had gone
back to their villages to brood over their reverse of
fortune.  The hotheads amongst them were not at
all satisfied at the easy way in which they had been
beaten out of their entrenchments on the Manjil
road.  Various pretexts were put forward with a
view of explaining away the sharp reverse they
suffered on that occasion.  Further, there was a
recrudescence of propaganda activity amongst them,
carried on by Turkish agents and sympathizers who
came and went in the jungle country on the shores
of the Caspian.
</p>

<p>
Bicherakoff and his Russians had gone off to
Baku, and a small force of British alone was holding
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
Resht.  Admirable for the Jungalis' plan, thought
their leaders!  This time they would be able to
settle their account with the British without any
intervening Russian mixing himself up in the business.
</p>

<p>
Early on July 20th a large force of Jungalis made
a surprise attack on Resht.  Aided by armed partisans
within who, once the attack developed, brought
hitherto concealed rifles into play from window and
roof-top, the enemy achieved a distinct measure of
success.  The street fighting was desperate and
severe.  The attacking force fought with great
bravery, determination, and skill.  They dug
themselves in, and threw up barricades the better to aid
them to hold ground they had won.
</p>

<p>
But, although the greater part of Resht passed
into their hands, following their first impetuous
dash, the Jungalis were never able to make
themselves masters of the south-western section of the
town which was held by British troops.  They
knocked their heads against this in vain.  It was
left to the armoured cars, moreover, once more to
demonstrate their great value in street fighting.
The heavy cars of the Brigade and the 6th Light
Armoured-Motor Battery were rushed into action,
and although the streets had been dug up by the
enemy in order to impair the mobility of the Brigade,
the latter made short work of the Jungalis, driving
them from point to point, and from street to street,
until the town was once more in our possession.
The enemy found themselves at a complete disadvantage
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
when facing armour-plated fighting machines.
The moral effect of these alone, apart from their fire
efficiency, proved disastrous to Jungali nerves, and
spread panic and disorganization in the ranks of the
foe.  Profiting by the bitter example of treachery
that the Jungali attack had furnished, the British
this time were less lenient when it came to imposing
terms upon the beaten enemy.
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of July signs of dissension showed
themselves amongst the Bolshevik militants who
controlled the political and military destinies of Baku,
a matter of which I wrote in the previous chapter.
The Turks were without the gates.  Bicherakoff had
gone north, and the Bolshevik military machine had
helplessly broken down.  It could neither organize
any scheme of defence, nor evolve any offensive plan
for relieving the city from the gradually tightening
grip of the Turk.  The people of Baku found that
mediocrity and mendacity were but poor and
unsatisfactory weapons with which to attempt to arrest
the march of a modern army, and these were about
all the Bolsheviks possessed in their mental arsenal.
Above the chaos and welter of discordant opinion
arose the murmurings of a discontented, fear-stricken
people.  They had suffered much from Bolshevik
oppression and from Bolshevik ineptitude, and
clamoured for a new set of <i>dramatis personæ</i> and the
recasting of the principal roles in the Baku tragedy.
So these political <i>farceurs</i>, the Bolsheviks, were
figuratively hissed off the boards, and disappeared
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
down the stage trap-door to an oblivion which,
alas! was but temporary.  They were baffled, but not
beaten.
</p>

<p>
Their places were taken by men holding saner and
less violent political views.  One of the first official
acts of the new Baku Government was to summon
the British to their aid.
</p>

<p>
It was the chance for which Dunsterville had lived
and waited, and he lost no time in grasping it.  At
Enzeli he embarked a mixed force of about two
thousand, made up of unattached Imperial and
Dominion officers of the original Dunsterforce, a
battalion or so of the North Staffords, a detachment
of Hants, howitzer and field gun sections, two
armoured cars, two sections of the motor machine-gun
company, and other sundry units and details which
had been commandeered from Resht for the move
upon Baku.
</p>

<p>
The advanced guard disembarked at the Caspian
oil port on August 5th, and the remainder speedily
followed.
</p>

<p>
The position in Baku was not one to inspire
confidence.  There were Bolshevik troops in the town
who did not attempt to conceal their displeasure at
the arrival of the British.  The "Red Committee,"
too, was gathering fresh strength and planning the
overthrow of its successors in office&mdash;the Government
that had invited Dunsterville to Baku.  Muddle and
confusion prevailed everywhere.  Jealousy, distrust,
and bickering were rife amongst the heterogeneous,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
ill-disciplined mass of Russians and Armenians which
passed for an army in Baku.  It was computed
that there were about 20,000 Russians of various
political hues, ranging from bright Bolshevik red to
sober Imperial grey, in and around the town, while
the number of Armenian auxiliaries was estimated
at 5,000.  Yet the brunt of the fighting had to
be borne by the British infantry, chiefly the North
Staffords, for it was rarely that over 5,000 of
our more than doubtful allies could be rounded up
to assist in holding the far-flung defensive line of
Baku.
</p>

<p>
Despite the stiffening of British troops in the front
line, the moral encouragement of British officers,
and the active material support of British artillery
and British armoured cars, it was found impossible
to infuse any real or lasting enthusiasm into the
Baku army.  It had its own ethics of fighting and
stuck to them.  War, it was felt, was a job not to be
taken too seriously, and must never be allowed to
interfere with one's customary distractions, nor with
one's business or social engagements.  Russians and
Armenians would leave a "back to-morrow" message,
and casually stroll out of the front-line trenches,
whenever they felt in the mood, to go off to attend
some political meeting in Baku, or seek refreshment
and questionable enjoyment at some of the local
cafés.
</p>

<p>
The position of the unattached British officers was
a difficult one in Baku.  They were there in an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
advisory capacity chiefly, but their counsel and
presence were alike resented by all parties, political
and military.  Suggestions for a more efficient
co-operation between infantry and artillery, for the
filling up of dangerous gaps in the line, the better
siting of trenches, or the establishing of observation
posts and the employment of "spotters," were
usually received in silence and with a disdainful shrug
of the shoulders.
</p>

<p>
While striving to beat off the Turk outside, the
British, too, had to sit on the head of the rabid
Bolshevik within, and prevent his regaining his feet
and running amuck once more.
</p>

<p>
The economic situation was also serious.  Food
supplies were lamentably short, and the available
stock was running low.  A super-commercial instinct
had been developed, and gross profiteering was
widely practised.  It was true that the pre-war
standard value of the paper rouble had suffered a
heavy depreciation, but this hardly justified the
exorbitant tariff of some of the Baku restaurants.
It was no uncommon thing for them to exact five
roubles for the bread eaten at meals, and about
seventy roubles for the very indifferent meal itself.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Keyworth, R.H.A., was appointed to the
command of the troops in the Baku area.  His
heavy duties confined him a good deal to the port
itself, and he was unable to see very much of the
defensive perimeter; but he had excellent coadjutors
in Colonel Matthews of the Hants, and in Colonel
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
Stokes of the Intelligence Department, an officer who
had been for many years British Military Attaché
in Teheran.  Then, too, there was Lieutenant-Colonel
Warden, a blunt, straight-spoken Canadian, and a
very keen and efficient infantry soldier whose
permanent telegraphic address in Flanders had been "Vimy
Ridge."  Warden was generally an optimist, but the
Baku problem was responsible for his passing sleepless,
unhappy nights; and finally he gave up attempting
to instil martial ardour into the non-receptive mind
of the Baku soldier.  In his own racy speech, redolent,
of his native prairie, he summed up his efforts in this
direction as being as futile as trying to flog a dead
horse back to life.
</p>

<p>
I am not so much concerned with describing the
military operations in detail as I am with laying
stress upon the many difficulties that beset the path
of the British during their first and short-lived
occupation of Baku.  The wonder is that, instead of
giving in after a few days, they were able to cling
to the position for weeks.
</p>

<p>
On August 26th, the Turks, who had been preparing
for days, delivered a heavy attack against
the Griazni-Vulkan sector.  Their advance took place
under cover of destructive artillery fire which caused
many casualties.  The section of the line where the
Turks struck first was held by about one hundred and
fifty of the North Staffords, supported by four
machine-guns of the Armoured Car Brigade.  Despite
severe losses, the Turks, being reinforced, pressed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
home the attack, and the auxiliary troops on the
right flank were flung back and forced to retire.  At
this point two of the machine-guns failed to hear the
order to retreat, and fought the Turks until their
crew were surrounded and cut off.  The other machine-gun
section, under Lieutenant Titterington, stuck it
to the last, and when they withdrew the Turks were
already firing upon them from the rear.  But the
surviving members of the gun crews managed to
"shoot" their way through the ranks of the foe.
</p>

<p>
The enemy, who had suffered very heavily in the
attack of the 26th, resumed the offensive on the 31st,
when he bit another slice out of the thinly held line
and captured the position known as Vinigradi Hill.
After this the Turk advanced from success to success,
slowly driving back the garrison on the inner defensive
line.

</p>

<p>
His crowning victory was the storming of the
Voltchi Vorota sector on the morning of September
14th.  An Arab officer who deserted two days
previously furnished full particulars of the
impending attack, but his information was regarded with
suspicion.  It proved, however, to be absolutely
correct, for the enemy made a feigned attack on the
neighbouring Baladjari sector and delivered his main
blow against Voltchi Vorota.  He got home at once,
driving out the Russian troops, who retreated in some
confusion.  An armoured car, however, intervened
between the retiring troops and the oncoming enemy,
and, although heavily shelled by the Turkish batteries,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
it manoeuvred adroitly, paralyzing the advance
by its deadly fire and allowing the broken Russians
time to reform with a leavening of British bayonets.
The Turks later in the day converted the feigned
into a real attack, and broke through at Baladjari.
</p>

<p>
This series of reverses contracted the daily
shrinking perimeter still more.  It was now clear to
Dunsterville that his troubled occupancy of Baku
had come to an end, and orders were issued for an
immediate evacuation.  The Bolsheviks had got the
upper hand again.  Their attitude was doubtful and,
in the first instance, they had objected to the troops
being withdrawn, threatening to use the Caspian
fleet of gunboats to fire on the laden transports
should the latter attempt to sail.  It was not exactly
altruism, nor the promptings of a generous nature,
that led them to do this.  On the contrary, it was
rather a tender regard for their own cowardly skins.
Should the victorious enemy storm the town the
British would serve as a useful chopping-block upon
which the Turks might expend their fury; and, if
the worst came to the worst, and there was no other
way out of a disagreeable dilemma, grace and favour
might be won from the Osmanli by uniting with him
in administering the <i>coup de grâce</i> to the trapped
and betrayed remnant of Dunsterville's Army of
Occupation.
</p>

<p>
Although the town lay defenceless and at their
mercy, the Turks&mdash;victims probably of their periodical
inertia&mdash;did not follow up their advantage.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
Bolsheviks hesitated to strike, and, after the
motor-cars, stores, and transport had been destroyed, the
evacuation was successfully carried out under the
menacing guns of the Caspian Fleet.
</p>

<p>
Captain Suttor, an Australian officer, and two
sergeants, were overlooked in the hurry of
embarkation.  But they escaped and, boarding a steamer
full of Bolshevik fugitives, induced the Captain to
land them at Krasnovodsk on the eastern shore of
the Caspian and the terminus of the Trans-Caspian
Railway.  Suttor knew that a British military post
had been established there.  Of this the Bolsheviks
were ignorant, and their fury and amazement were
great when they found themselves marched off as
prisoners.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br /><br />
THE TURKS AND THE CHRISTIAN TRIBES
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Guerrilla warfare&mdash;Who the Nestorian and other Christian tribes
are&mdash;Turkish massacres&mdash;Russian withdrawal and its
effect&mdash;British intervention.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Nestorians, Jelus, and other racially connected
Christian groups who, in the region around Lake
Urumia, had been carrying on a guerrilla warfare
against the Turks, at the beginning of July were
reduced to very sore straits indeed by losses in the
field, disease, and famine.
</p>

<p>
As already related in a previous chapter, Lieutenant
Pennington, a British aviator, flew into Urumia in the
first week in July, carrying General Dunsterville's
assurance of speedy help.  The leaders of these
Christian peoples, in full accord with the British,
decided that after evacuating Urumia an attempt
should be made to break through to the south in
the direction of Sain Kaleh and Bijar, in order to
get in touch with the British relieving column which
was marching north from Hamadan bringing ammunition
and food supplies.
</p>

<p>
For the better understanding of this narrative,
some explanation is due to the reader as to who and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
what are the Nestorians and their kindred Christian
clans who were now about to run the gauntlet of
the Turkish Army operating in the Lake Urumia
district.
</p>

<p>
The Nestorians are the followers of the Patriarch
of Constantinople who was condemned for heresy in
the year A.D. 431.  They inhabit Kurdistan and
north-western Persia, are also known as Assyrians,
and are indeed often loosely referred to as Syrians.
They live in that portion of the country which the
Bible has familiarized to us as Assyria, and are
confusedly termed Syrians, not because they come from
Syria proper on the Mediterranean littoral, with its
cities of Antioch, Aleppo, and Damascus, but rather
because their rubric and sacred writings are in ancient
Syriac, while the language of the people themselves
is modern Syriac.
</p>

<p>
Hundreds of years ago the seat of the Nestorian
or Assyrian Patriarchate was near Ctesiphon on the
Tigris, a short distance below Bagdad.  But the
Turkish conquerors persecuted the Christians, the
Patriarch was forced to flee, and finally took refuge
at Qudshanis, in the highlands of Kurdistan.  The
present spiritual head of the Assyrians, who is
ecclesiastically designated Mar Shimun, is said to be the
one hundred and thirty-eighth Catholicos, or
Patriarch, of the Nestorian Church.
</p>

<p>
At the outbreak of the European War there were
three distinguishable main groups of Assyrian
Christians.  One inhabited the Upper Tigris Valley beyond
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
Mesul and the hilly country towards Lake Van; a
second was to be found on the Salmas-Urumia
plateau and in the mountainous country bordering
on the Persian-Turkish frontier; the third group
lived on the Turkish side of the frontier between
Lake Van and Urumia.  Roughly they may be
classified as Highlanders and Lowlanders, with
various tribal subdivisions, of which one of the better
known is the Jelu group.
</p>

<p>
Urumia itself is the scene of considerable foreign
missionary activity, and is the headquarters of the
Anglican, American, French, and Russian religious
missions to the Assyrian Christians.  Each had its
own well-defined sphere of influence, and worked in
the broadest spirit of Christian tolerance.  When war
burst upon this unhappy land, anything in the nature
of sectarian rivalry and proselytizing zeal vanished,
to give place to a united effort to aid and materially
comfort the victims of Turkish fury.
</p>

<p>
The retreat of the Russians from Urumia, at the
beginning of January, 1915, left some thousands of
Urumia Christians who were unable to accompany
them at the mercy of the Turks and their savage
auxiliaries, the Kurds; and the usual massacre
followed.  The Christians, though poorly armed,
defended themselves as best they could, and the
survivors were driven to seek sanctuary in the American
Mission Compound.  Those who surrendered and
gave up their arms to the Turks were put to death
without mercy.  At the beginning of May, 1915, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
army of Halil Bey, operating in North-Western
Persia, was routed by the Russians, who reoccupied
Urumia.  But the beaten Turks in their retreat
westwards killed every Christian tribesman they could
find.  A second Russian evacuation of Urumia in
August, 1915, led to a fresh exodus of the able-bodied
Assyrian fighting men, and to another massacre
of those who remained behind.
</p>

<p>
From then until 1918 they had endured all the
horrors and vicissitudes of war, with its fluctuations
of victory and defeat.  The Christian army had put
up a brave fight against the Turks after the final
Russian withdrawal from North-Western Persia.
Now, hemmed in and suffering from hunger, they
were about to attempt a third exodus, this time
towards the South into the British lines.
</p>

<p>
During the last week in July the Christian
army&mdash;probably about 10,000 fighting men, but with
its ranks swelled to 30,000 by women and children
refugees&mdash;withdrew from Urumia and marched
southwards.  The Turks gave pursuit and much harried
their rearguard, which they subjected to artillery
fire, inflicting severe losses.  Ultimately the retreat
under Turkish pressure degenerated into a rout,
during which the mass of fugitives was severely cut
up.  In the course of the panic which prevailed, the
Nestorian Army lost its artillery and its remaining
supplies, while many of the women and children were
abandoned in the general <i>sauve qui pent</i>, and fell into
the hands of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
</p>

<p>
The Turks reoccupied Urumia on August 1st, and
vented their displeasure upon the defenceless people
in the customary Turkish way.  The aged were
killed, and young girls were carried off and subjected
to a fate worse than death.
</p>

<p>
Mgr. Sontag, the head of the French Lazarist
Mission, a saintly man who was revered even by the
local Moslems amongst whom he had lived for many
years, was one of those who fell victims to the blind
fury of the Turkish soldiery when they found
themselves once more masters of Urumia.
</p>

<p>
At Sain Kaleh and Takan Teppeh, to the north-west
of Bijar, the British were able to intervene
between pursuers and pursued.  The Nestorians, a
sadly diminished band, were drafted back to Bijar
and thence south to Hamadan.  Harbouring vindictive
feelings against Moslems in general as a result
of the atrocities perpetuated upon them by the Turks,
it is not perhaps surprising that they in their turn
made an onslaught upon the inhabitants of the
Persian villages encountered <i>en route</i>, and left them
in much the same condition as the man who, going
down from Jerusalem to Jericho, fell among thieves.
</p>

<p>
Mar Shimun, the spiritual head, and Agha Petros,
the recognized military leader, accompanied the
Nestorians from Urumia.  The survivors of the
exodus were put in a concentration camp at Hamadan
with their women and children.  The able-bodied
and healthy amongst the men were subsequently
drafted out and sent to Bakuba near Bagdad, where
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
an attempt was made by the British to organize and
train them into fighting units.  They received good
pay and rations, but proved very difficult material
to handle.  Their wild, free lives had apparently
unfitted them for a régime of discipline and ordered
restraint.  A large contingent refused to sign attestation
papers lest they should be sent to fight overseas.
It was useless attempting to reassure them on this
point, and to tell them that all the military service
they were expected to render in return for British
pay and British rations was that of defending their
own country against the common enemy, the Turk.
It may be that their physical sufferings had
demoralized them, but the irregulars of Agha Petros
were incapable of attaining an ordinary degree of
military efficiency as judged by British standards.
They were a perpetual source of embarrassment to
the British officers entrusted with their training.
The experiment proved a failure, and at last, on the
Turks suing for an armistice, the men of Agha Petros'
command were disbanded and sent back to their
own country.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br /><br />
IN KURDISTAN
</h3>

<p class="intro">
The last phase&mdash;Dunsterforce ceases to exist&mdash;The end of Turkish
opposition&mdash;Off to Bijar&mdash;The Kurdish tribes&mdash;Raids on
Bijar&mdash;Moved on by a policeman&mdash;Governor and poet.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was in South-Western Kurdistan that I saw the
last phase of the war between the Turks and ourselves.
</p>

<p>
At the end of September, Dunsterforce had ceased
to exist, at any rate under that name.  Dunsterville
himself had gone down to Bagdad to discuss the
whole Caucasian and North Persian situation with
General Headquarters, and the officers of Dunsterforce
had either gone back to their units in France,
Salonika, and Egypt, or had been absorbed by the
North Persian force which was concentrating under
General Thompson at Enzeli for a fresh smack at
the Turk in Baku.
</p>

<p>
After his capture of the oilfields' port, the enemy
seemed to have reached the last stages of physical
exhaustion, and to be incapable of further effort.
His push through from Tabriz towards Zinjan and
Kasvin had been finally arrested, and he had been
driven back to his entrenchments on the Kuflan
Kuh Pass, where he was well content to sit down to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
a peaceful, inoffensive life, smoke his hubble-bubble,
nurse his blistered feet lacerated by long marches
on unfriendly Persian roads, and, in general, by his
exemplary behaviour earn "good conduct" marks
from the inhabitants of the zone of occupation.
</p>

<p>
But in the country to the west of Mianeh and
south of Lake Urumia the enemy was still inclined
to spasmodic activity.  It was in this region that
he had harried the Nestorian Army as it was fighting
its way to the south and to safety.  At the beginning
of October, 1918, the Turks held Sauj Bulagh, the
local capital of the Kurds of Azerbaijan, Sakiz, Sain
Kaleh, and Takan Teppeh, all of which were in more
or less precarious touch with Kowanduz on the
western slopes of the Kurdistan Range, and thence
with the main and sole surviving Turkish
Mesopotamian Army which was clinging tenaciously to
Mosul.  Their occupation of these several strategic
points on the Persian side of the frontier enabled
the Turks to threaten the British post at Bijar, on
the confines of South-Western Kurdistan, and in a
sense to menace the British occupation of Hamadan.

</p>

<p>
But Allenby's smashing blow at the Turk in
Palestine had its repercussion in the remote
highlands of Persia and in the remoter region of the
Caspian Sea.  Its effect was instantaneous.  It broke
the Turkish grip on Baku and appreciably loosened
his hold on Azerbaijan.  He withdrew from Mianeh
and made ready to evacuate Tabriz and retire into
his own territory in an eleventh-hour effort to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
buttress up his remaining Asiatic provinces which,
one after the other, were tottering beneath the
sledgehammer blows of the British.
</p>

<p>
Early in October the wheel of fate and the illness
of a brother officer led to my being transferred from
Caspian Headquarters to Bijar, as Assistant Political
Officer and Intelligence Officer.  I looked it up on
the map and started.  It was a long and interesting
zigzag trek across Persia, first south-west to
Hamadan, then north-west to Bijar and the wild
country of the Kurdish tribes.
</p>

<p>
Few Europeans can lay claim to any intimate
knowledge of Kurdistan and its predatory but
fascinating people.  It is distinctly remote from the
beaten tourist track.  Russian and German travellers
and scholars have nibbled at the ethnological and
philological problems which it presents, and, much
more recently, our own Major Soane in his remarkable
book, "Through Kurdistan in Disguise," draws aside
the veil a little, and we are able to take a peep at
Kurdish life and manners naturally portrayed.
</p>

<p>
Kurdistan cannot be said to possess either natural
or political boundaries, for it embraces both Persian
and Turkish territory, and in it live people who are
not racially Kurds.  Broadly speaking, it may be
said to stretch from Turkish Armenia on the north
to the Luristan Mountains on the south, and the
Turkish-Persian frontier cuts it into two longitudinal
sections.  Persian Kurdistan, then, is bounded by
Azerbaijan on the north, the Turkish frontier on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
west, Kermanshah on the south, and Khamseh and
Hamadan on the east.  Its old administrative capital
is Sinneh.
</p>

<p>
Its geographical outline is one of bold and rugged
mountains which in winter are covered deep in snow.
Narrow valleys run far into the flank of the towering
hills, and it is here, taking advantage of these natural
barriers, that the villages cluster and the inhabitants
attempt to keep warm during the long, bitter, and
often fireless, winter months.
</p>

<p>
A nonsense rhymester who evidently knew something
of the proclivities of the Kurds once scored
a palpable bull's-eye on the target of truth when he
wrote:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The hippo's a dull but honest old bird;<br />
  I wish I could say the same of the Kurd."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Kurds themselves have more traducers than
friends outside their own country.  As the great
majority of them are Sunni Moslems, it has been
pointed out, and with a certain element of truth, that
the root of the Persian-Kurdish Question is the
religious hatred between Sunni and Shi'ah, just as
the root of the Turkish problem is the undying hatred
between Moslems and Christians.  Kurmanji, the
main Kurdish language, has been incorrectly described
as a corrupt dialect of Persian, whereas it is really
a distinct philological entity, tracing an unbroken
descent from the ancient Medic or Avestic tongue of
Iran.
</p>

<p>
I had a good deal to do officially with several of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
the principal Kurdish tribes, such as the Mukhri,
Mandumi, and Galbaghi, while I was stationed at
Bijar, and I cannot agree with the generally accepted
estimate of their character as "a lazy, good-for-nothing
set of thieves."  They are admittedly fierce
and intractable, of noted predatory habits, and ready
to prey with equal impartiality upon Persian or
Christian neighbour.  On the other hand, I found
that they were neither cruel nor treacherous; they
are never lacking in courage, and possess a rude, but
well-defined sense of hospitality and chivalry.
</p>

<p>
Unarmed, save for a riding-crop, and accompanied
only by a few Sowars, I have gone into their villages
in search of raiders&mdash;not always a pleasant task
amongst Asiatic hill tribes&mdash;and the inhabitants
would be amiability itself.  Here one saw the happier
side of these wild, free people who, revelling in the
unrestrained life and the health-giving ozone of their
native mountains, find the trammelling yoke of
modern civilization about as irksome and fearful an
infliction as a bit and saddle are to an unbroken colt.
</p>

<p>
What I liked about the Kurds was their habit&mdash;the
common inheritance of most free men&mdash;of looking
their interlocutor straight in the face.  Their women,
many possessing great physical beauty, and glorious
creatures all, would crowd round to do the honours
to those visiting their village.  Amongst the Kurds
the women are allowed a great deal of freedom.
They shoot and ride like so many Amazons.  It is
true they are the hewers of wood and the drawers of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
water in the village or community, but, save for
lacking parliamentary enfranchisement, they do not
seem to have many grievances against the masculine
portion of the Kurdish world.  They always go
unveiled, are not a bit "man-shy," and, unlike their
Moslem sisters in Turkey and Persia, do not consider
themselves spiritually defiled when their faces are
gazed upon by some Infidel whom chance has thrown
across their path.
</p>

<p>
From this I do not wish it to be inferred that the
Kurdish women are immodest in conduct, or of
what might be described as "flighty morals."  Far
from it.
</p>

<p>
These self-same tribesmen who received us so
hospitably in their villages, and gave us entertainment
of their best&mdash;treating us in friendly fashion
according to their laws, because we had come trusting
to their honour in the guise of friends and without
hostile intent&mdash;would, when they took the "war
path" and raided a British post, put up a spirited
fight, fully bent on killing or being killed.
</p>

<p>
Persian Kurds are largely pastoral and nomadic.
There are the sedentary tribes who are the tillers of
the soil and never move very far away from home.
The nomads, on the other hand, roam with their
flocks and herds and womenfolk from winter to
summer quarters and vice versa, and it is during
these periodical migrations that the inherited
predatory instincts of the Kurds are given free rein.
Many are the armed forays made on a peaceful
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
Persian neighbour's stock.  Often there is resistance,
and occasionally an attempt at reprisals; so a
respectably-sized Persian-Kurdish hill-war may have had
as its origin the theft of half a dozen goats by Kurdish
robbers.  Stray bands of brigands who had made
life more than usually interesting for some Persian
village or other, if pursuit became too vigorous and
they were threatened with capture, were always able
to escape the consequences of their depredations by
slipping over the frontier and seeking bast (sanctuary)
in Turkish territory.
</p>

<p>
Whether the Kurds are, or are not, the descendants
of those first-class fighting men of long ago who
opposed the retreat of the Ten Thousand through the
bleak mountain passes of Kurdistan, they undeniably
are imbued with a certain pride of ancestry which
manifests itself in various little ways.  No pure
nomadic Kurd will ever engage in manual labour,
which he looks upon as a disgrace, and a job fit only
for helots, nor will he become a Charvadar (muleteer).
</p>

<p>
The Kurd undoubtedly possesses an unenviable
reputation for lawlessness amongst the more
law-abiding Persians and Turks of this wild and turbulent
frontier land.  He is handicapped, perhaps, to this
extent, that, being an alien to the Turk in language,
and to the Persian in religion, he is looked upon as
a pariah, and the hand of both is ever raised against
him.  Being resentful and overbearing, if not
arrogant, in manner, and knowing no legal code beyond
that which a rifle imposes, he seeks to enforce his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
own arbitrary ready-made justice, to call it by that
name.  So the merry game goes on, and up amongst
the snows of Kurdistan Persian and Kurd and Turk
kill each other on the slightest pretext, and often for
no ascertainable cause.
</p>

<p>
The Kurd is always well armed, and usually well
mounted&mdash;often at the expense of some lowland
Persian villager.  He invariably affects the national
costume, which is an abbreviated coat and enormous
baggy trousers, with a capacious Kamarband of
coloured silk in which he carries pipe, knife, and
odds and ends.
</p>

<p>
Ten armed Kurds riding into Bijar, a town of
10,000 inhabitants, would start a panic in the
Bazaar.  Shutters would go up and shopkeepers
would vanish as if by magic, while the small force
of Persian police in the place, who were usually
suffering from the combined effects of malnutrition
and arrears of pay, would discreetly go to cover, and
not be seen again until the visitors had departed.
Usually a British military policeman, armed with a
stout stick, would be sent to handle the delicate
situation, to see that there was no looting, and that
the King's peace was preserved inviolate by these
quarrel-seeking, pilfering rascals from beyond the
hills.
</p>

<p>
Bijar itself, unhappily for the peace of mind and
pocket of its shopkeeper-citizens and wealthy
agriculturists, is unhealthily near the "Bad Man's
Land" of the nomad Kurds.  It is built in a cup-shaped
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
hollow surrounded by barren peaks, and its
altitude (5,200 feet) gives it a rigorous winter climate.
The enclosed gardens which usually lend a touch of
picturesque embellishment even to the meanest and
dirtiest of Persian towns are lacking at Bijar.  It
grows wheat and corn in abundance on the long,
wide plateau which stretches unbrokenly for miles
between the bare, rugged hills.  The arable land is
so fertile, and its acreage so abundant, that but
one-third is cultivated yearly.  The average wheat
yield is enormous, yet the people are always hovering
on the border-line of starvation, the result of
mismanagement, misappropriation, and all the other
evils which may be grouped together under the head
of Persian official maladministration.
</p>

<p>
When the British marched into Bijar in the summer
of 1918 anarchy and disorder were paramount.  The
Persian Government is supposed to keep a garrison
here, but the oldest inhabitants had never seen it.
If it did exist, it was carefully hidden away and not
allowed to meddle in such troublesome affairs as
Kurdish forays.  The Turks during their occupancy
looted Bijar very thoroughly, and roving Kurds, too,
when short of supplies&mdash;and that was often&mdash;never
forgot to extend their unwelcome patronage to the
local bazaars, on the principle of "Blessed is he that
taketh, for he shall not want."
</p>

<p>
The Governor was a local resident, and his office
an unpaid one as far as the Persian treasury was
concerned; but his power was great and his rule
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
arbitrary, and the post brought him considerable
emoluments.  He was a timid and vacillating but
well-meaning individual, who always trembled at the
knees when brought face to face with the unusual.
The mere brandishing of a loaded pistol anywhere
in his immediate vicinity would throw him into a
paroxysm of terror.  He spoke halting French, and
was afflicted with the prevailing Persian mania for
verse-writing.  Still, he never allowed his literary
pursuits to clash with or nullify his keen commercial
instincts; and he grew daily in affluence.
</p>

<p>
But even a Persian peasant has his limits of
endurance when he finds himself being ground to fine
powder in the mill of oppression and corruption.
Those of the Bijar district were no exception.  After
having been systematically looted all round, by
Turk, Kurd, and dishonest local officials, they rose
in revolt when a demand was made upon them for
the payment of the Government Maliat, or grain
tribute.  They followed up an emphatic refusal by
threatening to duck the Governor and his coadjutor,
the Tax-collector, in the local horsepond.  The latter
fled the town, while as for the terrified Governor,
he promptly shut himself up, seeking bast (sanctuary)
with an ill-armed following within the sacred precincts
of his serai.  From the roof, one of his retinue,
using his hands for a megaphone, sent out an urgent
S.O.S. call to the British, with the result that a
compromise was effected; the Governor was rescued
from his undignified plight, and the angry peasants
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
were appeased by his promise that the collection of
the unpopular tax would rest in abeyance until
Teheran gave its decision on the subject.
</p>

<p>
Our job in sitting down in Bijar was to hold the
place against the Turks and prevent their coming
back, to instil a little wholesome respect for law and
order into the minds of the plunder-loving Kurds,
and to stop them from eating up the smaller and
unprotected Persian fry.  To keep the Turk at bay
and hold the Kurd in awe, we had approximately
a couple of squadrons of the 14th Hussars, under
Colonel Bridges, a detachment of the Gloucesters in
charge of Captain Stephenson, machine-gun and
mountain battery sections, and a couple of hundred
of Persian levies who were commanded by Captain
Williams, an Australian officer.  Colonel Bridges was
in command of the whole force.  The total certainly
did not err on the side of numerical superiority.
</p>

<p>
The day after I reached Bijar the Governor arrived
to pay an official call.  After the usual formalities
as laid down by Persian etiquette for ceremonies of
this kind had been safely negotiated, he begged my
acceptance of a manuscript copy of his poems, and
incidentally hinted that, as the district was in the
throes of famine, he would have no objection to
collaborating in the purchasing of wheat with British
money in order to alleviate the prevailing distress.

CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><br />
THE END OF HOSTILITIES
</h3>

raiders&mdash;An embarrassing offer of marriage&mdash;Prestige by

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I have often wondered if the British who stayed at
home, through force of circumstances rather than
any reluctance to participate in the Great War, can
have had any conception of the varying types of men
who helped to uphold British interests in this remote
and little-known corner of the Asiatic Continent.
Here, then, are a few of them taken at random!
</p>

<p>
There was Hooper, an Australian Captain, who in
civil life was a farmer on a rock-girt island off the
Tasmanian coast, and had been through more than
one big push in France.  Williams, also an Australian
officer, was a Rhodes Scholar from the University of
Adelaide.  He commanded Persian levies, made a
hobby of dialects, and was always eager to try his
growing wisdom teeth on such abstruse problems as
"How the camel got his hump," or, "Why Jonah
gave the whale indigestion."  But he was a good
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
lad, was this youthful pedant, a fearless soldier, and
an untiring worker who, in a few months, gained a
surprising knowledge of colloquial Persian.  Then
there was Seddon, a Government land surveyor from
New Zealand, who also had looked on Red War in
Flanders.  In cold weather, of all times, he was
always shedding surplus garments, until there was
a positive danger of his arriving at the stage of the
"altogether."  Seddon was fiercely intractable on
the subject of hygiene as applied to clothing, and
would hear of no compromise where his cherished
principles were concerned.  It was said that he was
wont to lie awake at night planning new curtailments
in his winter kit.  Still, there must have been some
wisdom in his methods, for, although thinly clad
during the early winter months, he was always in
perfect health, and escaped the pulmonary maladies
which proved fatal to so many others who looked
askance at him and his hygienic, minimum-clothing
theory.
</p>

<p>
We had Gordon Wilson who came from the Argentine
to enlist at the outbreak of the War and attempted
to leap the age-limit barrier.  His ardour was
somewhat damped on being refused by the Home
Authorities.  But, nothing daunted, he went to France,
joined the Foreign Legion, and saw a good deal of
fighting.  He was afterwards transferred to a British
Field Battery and given a commission, and lost no
time in winning the M.C.
</p>

<p>
In the 14th Hussars was a lieutenant named Voigt,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
an Afrikander born, who had gone through the South
African campaign.  One day, riding with Voigt and
his troop of Hussars in a "punitive" expedition
against raiding Kurds, I asked him casually&mdash;and
quite forgetful of the momentous past&mdash;with whom
he had served in South Africa.  He replied with the
flicker of a smile on his broad, sun-tanned face, "I
was with Louis Botha's commando."  And such is
the material out of which has been woven our thrilling
island story!
</p>

<p>
Up to the moment of the Turkish collapse, towards
the end of October, many of the notables of Bijar
were inclined to be dubious concerning our possibility
of success.  These cautious individuals shaped their
conduct accordingly.  They "hedged" very carefully,
to use a sporting phrase, and, in order to avoid all
risks, backed both sides.  One wealthy Persian
resident whom I particularly remember was lavish
of lip-service.  He would call round to the Mission
Headquarters at least twice a week to assure us of
his ever-enduring devotion, and of his hopes of
success for British arms.  About the same time he
would be sending off a courier to the Turkish
commander in our front telling him that he was his
devoted servitor and that it would be a blessed day
for all True Believers when the Infidel British were
driven out of Persian Kurdistan.  So much for
Persian duplicity.  Our "friend" was a confirmed
"pulophile," which is an impromptu Perso-Greek
expression for "money-lover," and, while awaiting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
our military downfall, he had no conscientious
objections to seeking to rob us right and left in wheat
transactions.
</p>

<p>
On the whole the various Kurdish chiefs kept their
peace pact with the British, and for a time strove
hard to walk in the path of honesty and to cease
from annexing their neighbours' flocks and herds.
But occasionally temptation proved too strong to be
resisted, and there would come a recrudescence of
pillaging and violence.  The Mandumis and the
Galbaghis were the chief offenders.  Their subtle
imagination was never at a loss for a plausible pretext
to condone their lawlessness.  Once, when Mandumi
tribesmen attacked a British post at an outlying
village called Nadari, a certain Mustafa Khan, the
chief of the guilty raiders, sent a very apologetic
letter pleading for forgiveness, and pointing out that
the regrettable occurrence arose through a
"misunderstanding" on the part of his tribesmen who
possessed an inordinate love of well-conditioned
sheep.  Times were hard, and if the poor Kurds
were not to be allowed to replenish their larders by
the time-honoured method of pilfering, then, in the
name of Allah, he asked, what was to become of
them?  This curious and essentially Kurdish plea
of "extenuating circumstances" was backed up by
a letter from the tribal Mujtahid, or priest, who wrote
that he was a simple man of God saying his prayers
regularly and knowing little of secular affairs.  His
tribesmen had evidently been maligned by their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
enemies&mdash;"May the Evil One pluck their beards!"  He
had always exhorted his people to remain friendly
with the British, and would continue to do so.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion Mustafa Khan escaped with a
fine and a reprimand, but he was obviously looking
for trouble, and it soon overtook him.  He became
very insolent.  Some of his men stopped and robbed
the British native courier, and the Chief sent a
message that he would soon come and raid Bijar
itself.  There was nothing to do except to teach
Mustafa Khan a much-needed lesson.  However,
before the salutary drubbing could be administered,
Mustafa and his men, throwing discretion to the
winds, and forgetful of their oft-repeated promises
to be of good behaviour, got completely out of hand,
cleaned out several Persian villages, and indulged
in a veritable orgy of lawlessness.
</p>

<p>
Then Mustafa, with consummate skill, having no
case of his own, set about abusing the other side.
He blamed the hapless villagers, and accused them
of having killed two of his Sowars who had gone
into the Persian village to "purchase" corn.  The
villagers in question, he remarked, were liars, and
the sons of the Father of Lies&mdash;"May perdition be
their lot!"  But this time his defence of provocation
was found to be unjustifiable; a richly deserved
punishment was meted out to him, and for long
afterwards he led an exemplary life.
</p>

<p>
Nabi Khan was another Kurdish freebooter who
gave considerable trouble before he was finally
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
subdued and made to see the error of his ways.
From the point of view of stature and general
physique he was one of the finest looking men I
have ever seen.  He stood a good 6 feet 4 inches in
his socks, belying the prevailing idea that the Kurds
are of small stature.  In an evil moment for himself,
he threw in his lot with the Turks, and for a brief
period made things right merry for the British.  He
fought like an enraged tiger in defence of his village
stronghold, but was put to flight after suffering
severe loss.  He thought the thing out for a couple
of weeks, and then, like the old sportsman that he
was, came in and surrendered, saying that he had
lost, and was ready to pay the full price.  It is easy
to be generous to a chivalrous foe, and Nabi had
been all that, so he found that he had not thrown
himself upon our mercy in vain.
</p>

<p>
I well remember the morning that Nabi surrendered.
His name and his fame had preceded him
to Bijar, and, as he strode down the Bazaar with a
belt full of lethal weapons, his very appearance
inspired terror in the breasts of the pusillanimous
Persian traders, and they bolted for cover like so
many scared animals.  In addition to his stature,
Nabi was a man of handsome appearance.  He had
a bold, open countenance, and was brief and blunt
of speech.  Brushing past the startled Persian janitor,
whom he disdained to notice, he made a dramatic
entry into the Political Office at Bijar.  Flinging his
weapons on the table, he exclaimed, "I have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
foolish; aye, misguided by evil counsellors; I have
lost, and am here to pay the price.  Do with me
what you will.  But you may tell your Shah that
I regret the past and am willing to make amends."  Peace
was arranged with Nabi Khan, and the pact
he kept very faithfully, becoming one of our most
ardent partisans in the difficult country and amongst
the turbulent folk over whom he held sway.  He
policed his district, and did it very thoroughly,
proving a veritable terror to evildoers; and he
suppressed Turkish propaganda with a vigour that
demonstrated his real earnestness in the British
cause.
</p>

<p>
After the manner of his kind, as a further evidence
of his good faith, and in order to set a time-enduring
seal upon his treaty of friendship, he was anxious
to negotiate a Kurdish-British matrimonial alliance.
After a good deal of preliminary verbal manoeuvring,
he definitely broached the project, and suggested
the giving in marriage of his daughter, a very comely
damsel, to the Political Officer.  The latter was
completely taken aback and, not being a Moslem,
had visions of all sorts of unpleasant legal
complications should he ever set foot in England with a
supplementary wife.  However, he faced the trying
situation with commendable fortitude, and cast about
for a means whereby he might be enabled to retreat
with honour, and without offending Kurdish
susceptibilities.  Nabi was tactfully informed that,
while the offer was much appreciated, the acceptance
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
of a Kurdish bride would entail no end of complications
for at least one of the parties concerned, as an
unsympathetic British law had long set its face
against bigamy.  In fact, isolated enthusiasts in
khaki who, as a relief from the tedium of trench
life, had sought to popularize plural marriages in
England had been rewarded by a term of imprisonment.
This was news indeed for the benevolent-minded
Nabi, but he did not insist further, and the
incident terminated happily.
</p>

<p>
The Kurds are in many respects as simple as
European children of tender age.  They had heard
much about the wonderful flying machines of
Faringistan, and, never having seen an aeroplane,
were inclined to be sceptical, and to treat reputed
aerial adventures as so many "travellers' tales."  A
Kurdish chief came to call on me one day seeking
enlightenment.  He had seen automobiles, and
admitted that they puzzled his primitive brain.  "Why,"
he asked honestly enough, "is the horse put inside
the box, and why does this strange creature prefer
petrol to barley by way of food?"  It took a long
time to knock into his head some primitive notion
of motor traction.  Then he inquired, "Is it true
that in Faringistan, as currently reported, men make
themselves into birds and soar in the air like
eagles?"  The reply, as they say in Parliament, was in the
affirmative, but the Kurdish seeker for knowledge
remained frankly incredulous.  A few days after the
conversation, a youthful Scottish aviator, who was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
familiarly known as "Little Willie McKay," arrived
by air from Hamadan in order to give Bijar and the
Kurdistan hill-folk a taste of his quality.  It was a
day of days, and inaugurated a new era in the local
Mohammedan calendar, for it marked the flight of
the terror-stricken Faithful towards a place of safety
away from the aerial monster that, appearing from
out of a clear sunlight sky, swooped down on the
town.  The youthful McKay was a noted aerial
stunt artist, and he executed an extensive and varied
programme for the edification of those of the
astonished onlookers who had steeled their courage to
the point of sticking it out.  The houses are
flat-roofed, and here the spectators assembled to watch
the show.  As the aviator nose-dived occasionally,
it was amusing to see the celerity with which they
dropped flat on their faces, fearing lest they should
be caught by the talons of the "man-bird" and
carried off heaven knew where.  Later on, at the
local aerodrome, the people came, timidly enough at
first, to peep at the monster; but they did their
sightseeing cautiously from a respectful distance, and it
was only necessary for the engine to throb once or
twice fretfully, and for the propeller to revolve, to
bring about an instantaneous stampede.  Thenceforth
no one ever doubted that the British were
miracle workers, and had at their disposal an
unlimited supply of magic to assist in the overthrowing
of their enemies.
</p>

<p>
The Moharran, or anniversary of the death of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P245"></a>245}</span>
Hossain the Martyr, is an occasion for the display
of great religious fervour by the Shi'ite Moslems.
It fell on October 17th, and the Bijar Bazaar was
closed and the houses draped in mourning.  It is
perhaps the only day in the year when the average
Persian looks in deadly earnest, and when his
fanaticism is aroused to such a pitch as to make him
at all dangerous to persons of other creeds.  There
was a procession through the streets, and the chief
incidents of the martyrdom were re-enacted by a
devoted band of Shias.  The "body" of the Sainted
One was carried on a bier and, in order that the
finishing touch of realism should not be lacking, the
covering of the bier was plentifully bedaubed with
blood, while the head of the "corpse" was enveloped
in gory bandages.  The <i>mise en scène</i> was completed
by the addition of a local troupe representing Hossain's
wives and adherents who, according to legend, were
also put to death by the hated rival sect, the Sunnis.
The followers in the procession, in a burst of
religious frenzy, gashed their faces or bodies with
swords or knives, and, with blood streaming from
the self-inflicted wounds, were not exactly a pleasant
spectacle to look upon.  A Persian youth employed
at the British Headquarters was one of those who
achieved religious merit and local distinction on the
occasion.  Having volunteered for the role of
follower, he had his head cut open by a local barber,
and off he went to join in the quasi-religious
ceremony.  In the afternoon he was back at his job
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P246"></a>246}</span>
with his poor damaged head swathed in bandages
and feeling very proud indeed of his exploit.
</p>

<p>
Bijar was very excited by the intelligence that
arrived on November 1st. We received an official
notification that an armistice had been concluded
with Turkey, at the request of the latter Power, and
that hostilities were to cease at once. The Governor
made an official call to offer his felicitations, and
to congratulate the British on their triumph over
another of their enemies. He dissimulated his real
feelings with great artfulness, for while openly
professing joy at our victory he was sorrowing in secret
that a Moslem Power should have been overthrown
by an Infidel. Still, he made the best of it, and
candidly told some of his intimates who were inclined
to be tearful because their religious pride had been
wounded by the success of our arms, that the British,
after all, had shown more real humanity and
compassion in dealing with the oppressed Persians than
ever had their coreligionists, the Turks.
</p>

<p>
The Governor having set the example in offering
his congratulations, all the local notables were quick
to follow, and they told us what, curiously enough?
we had never realized before&mdash;that throughout the
long-drawn-out War they had always ardently wished
for the complete triumph of the British. We accepted
their assurances, although finding it difficult to
reconcile them with many of their actions when our
military fortunes were not of the brightest.
</p>

<p>
An official communication was sent off by messenger
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P247"></a>247}</span>
to the Turkish commander, informing him of the
armistice, and inquiring if he were prepared to abide
by its conditions and order a cessation of hostilities
on his side. But the enemy had evidently had the
news as soon as we had, and decided to end the war
then and there. When our messenger reached the
Turkish position, it was only to find the place
abandoned, the commander and every man having gone,
leaving no address. The messenger trekked after
them for a day, but their haste was so great that
he was unable even to come up with their rearguard,
so he returned to Bijar with the letter undelivered.
And that was the last we heard of the Turk in the
region of Southern Kurdistan.
</p>

<p>
Everybody in Bijar was now our sincere friend and
well-wisher. The Bazaar was beflagged in honour of
our victory. Ours was the winning side, of that
there could be no doubt. The Governor was more
assiduous than ever in his professions of undying
devotion, and he was always planning fresh schemes
for manifesting his goodwill and friendship. He even
hit upon the expedient of declaring an amnesty for
Persians incarcerated in the local gaol. At his
urgent solicitation, I visited the prison to decide
upon the offenders who were to benefit by this
generosity. It was a filthy, evil-smelling hole. Lying
upon a stone floor were about a dozen offenders, all
huddled together and chained like so many wild
beasts. There was a Jew who had been arrested for
debt. He wore round his neck a heavy iron collar
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P248"></a>248}</span>
like the joug of the Scottish pillory. He speedily
divined my mission, and was clamorously insistent
that he should be the first to be set free. Chained
to him were two Persians, one of whom had been
arrested for manslaughter and the other for petty
larceny.
</p>

<p>
In this foetid den, and near the trio already
mentioned, was a young Persian girl of attractive
appearance&mdash;an unregenerate Magdalene, as it turned out,
who had been put in chains for a breach of the
somewhat elastic Persian law governing public morality.
She alone made no protestation of innocence and no
appeal for release. Perhaps that was why I
suggested she should be the first to have her fetters
struck off and be set free. She seemed dumbfounded
at first, but on realizing that liberty awaited her,
she burst into tears, and showed her gratitude by
kissing my hand. It seemed a pity to leave the other
poor wretches, however guilty they might have been,
to rot in this terrible dungeon; so I availed myself
to the full of the privilege of the amnesty and asked
that all should be liberated, including the loquacious
Jew debtor. This was done, and the poor, dazed
creatures walked out of the prison doors and once
more breathed the purer air of freedom.
</p>

<p>
With the granting of the armistice to Austria came
the welcome orders for the British force to evacuate
Bijar and retire to Hamadan. On news of Austria's
defection from the side of her German ally becoming
known, the Governor arrived to offer fresh felicitations.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P249"></a>249}</span>
But a shadow clouded his beaming self-satisfied
countenance when he learned that the
British were to withdraw immediately. He became
greatly perturbed at the news, for he feared the
ever-present menace of Kurdish incursions, and
trembled for the safety of Bijar and the wealth of
its Bazaar. "What will become of us all?" he
asked in despair. "When the British go, the Kurds
will come, and then&mdash;&mdash;"  He made a significant
gesture across his throat.
</p>

<p>
The Governor returned next day with a deputation
of the inhabitants to ask that a British garrison
might be left behind to carry out the duty which
really devolved upon the Persian Government, that
of protecting its subjects against acts of lawlessness.
He pleaded hard and earnestly. They would find
fuel, food, and quarters free for the soldiers who
were to remain. First he suggested twenty, then
a dozen, and finally he said, "Take pity on us, and
send a message by the lightning-flash (wireless) to
the British King asking him to permit three of his
soldiers to remain here to protect the people. Then
the Kurds will never bother us at all."  It was
certainly a tribute to our worth and fighting value.
Gently but firmly the Governor had to be led to
understand that it was impossible. The soldiers had
homes and wives in far-off Faringistan across the
Black Water; their duty was done, and home they
must go.
</p>

<p>
The deputation set off with bowed heads and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P250"></a>250}</span>
sorrowing hearts. It was kismet, and the decree of
Destiny could not be set aside.
</p>

<p>
The wealthier inhabitants, however, made every
effort to save themselves and their worldly
possessions. All available transport was bought up at
enhanced prices, and an exodus from Bijar preceded
the British evacuation.
</p>

<p>
On November 7th Colonel Bridges and his column
bade farewell to Bijar. The inhabitants, or at least
those of them who were too poor to take flight, turned
out <i>en masse</i> to speed the parting troops. They
had got to know and to admire the splendid British
soldier who is always a gentleman, who had fought
the battle of the Persian people against Kurdish
brigand and Turkish regular, and whose ofttimes
scanty ration he was always ready to share with
any roadside starveling who crossed his path. The
Governor and a numerous retinue rode for two miles
with the head of the column. On a bare plateau,
exposed to a keen, biting wind, and under a lowering
sky, the last farewells were cordially exchanged. The
Governor told us that the British had left behind an
ineffaceable record for justice and generosity. I
think it was sincerely meant and devoid of any
exaggeration.

</p>

<p>
It took seven days to reach Hamadan. The snow
overtook us on the second day out, and the bitter
Kurdistan winter set in with extreme severity. The
Indian transport camels, unaccustomed to extreme
cold, and not possessing the thick fur coating of their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P251"></a>251}</span>
Afghan brother, died in numbers, and the Indian
Charvadars followed their example.
</p>

<p>
From Hamadan there was the long trek down-country
and over the snow-clad Asadabad Pass. But
the weather grew milder and brighter as we steadily
dropped down from the high altitudes, neared the
warmer plains of Mesopotamia, and left Persia behind
us. At last came the day when our long overland
journey was to end, and Xenophon's war-worn
soldiers never cried more exultingly "Thalatta!"
"Thalatta!" at the sight of the sea, than we did on
reaching the shores of the Persian Gulf.

<h3>
APPENDIX
<br /><br />
THE WORK OF THE DUNSTERFORCE ARMOURED CAR BRIGADE
</h3>

<p>
I am giving the following account of the work of the
Armoured Car Brigade with General Dunsterville's
Mission, not only because the Brigade deserves fuller
mention than I have been able to give elsewhere in
this book, but because some description of their
operations will give a better idea of the difficulties
of transport, stores, etc., with which the whole force
had to deal.  For my facts in this instance I have
been allowed access to an official report by the men
who actually did the work.
</p>

<p>
The Brigade, commanded by Colonel J. D. Crawford,
was organized in squadrons of eight cars each.  In
addition it had a mobile hospital of fifty beds, and
the usual supply column.
</p>

<p>
The Brigade had originally been known as the
Locker-Lampson Armoured Car Unit, and its work
in Russia in the earlier stages of the war is one of
the most stirring stories of the whole campaign.  For
its present work, it began to mobilize in England
during the latter months of 1917.  The personnel was
obtained by the transfer from the R.N.A.S.  of officers
and men who had been serving in the Armoured Car
Unit in Russia.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P253"></a>253}</span>
</p>

<p>
Owing to the internal conditions of Russia, the
personnel arrived in small parties at long intervals,
the last party leaving Russia as late as March, 1918.
The unit was made up to strength by the enlistment
of personnel from motor and other munition works
in England.  The cars and material were all to be
provided from England, and the necessary orders
for their manufacture were issued without delay.
The armoured cars were of Austin make, and mounted
two machine-guns in twin turrets.
</p>

<p>
A demand for the early presence of some cars with
the Mission necessitated the despatch of an advanced
party, the last draft of which landed in May, 1918.
</p>

<p>
This party consisted of 21 officers, 450 other ranks,
with 8 armoured cars, 24 lorries, 30 touring cars,
44 Ford box vans, 32 motor-cycles, and other stores
and equipment.
</p>

<p>
That it was impossible to concentrate and fully
equip the unit in England before despatch overseas
was unavoidable, but unfortunate from the point of
view of organization.  The delay in the despatch of
the remainder of the unit was a further misfortune.
The absence of many of the specialist personnel and
much of the essential equipment increased the
difficulties with which the Brigade was faced.  Some
of the personnel and considerable equipment never
reached the Brigade until it was withdrawn from
Persia.
</p>

<p>
Of the personnel that did arrive nearly 40 per
cent. had only joined the Army in January, 1918, were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P254"></a>254}</span>
devoid of all training, and had often no mechanical
knowledge.
</p>

<p>
By May 15th the advanced party, together with
such cars and personnel as arrived later, were
concentrated at Hinaidi, and preparations for the move
into Persia were rapidly pushed forward.
</p>

<p>
On May 14th a start was made to establish petrol
dumps at Tak-i-Garra, Kermanshah, and Hamadan,
and by May 15th these were sufficiently stocked to
permit of the move of "A" Squadron, which left
Hinaidi on May 17th.  In connection with the
establishment of these dumps it is worthy of note that
the Brigade Peerless lorries were the first heavy
lorries to cross the Pai Tak and Asadabad Passes,
in spite of expert opinion that the road was
impassable for heavy lorries.
</p>

<p>
It will be simpler to follow the actual operations
of the Brigade if each series of operations, although
concurrent, are dealt with separately:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
1. Operations against the Jungalis.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
2. Operations with General Bicherakoff's Force in
the Caucasus.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
3. Operations at Baku.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
4. Operations at Zinjan.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
OPERATIONS AGAINST THE JUNGALIS.
</p>

<p>
"A" Squadron arrived at Hamadan on June 7th.
At this time General Bicherakoff's troops were
concentrating at Manjil.  The Jungalis under Kuchik
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P255"></a>255}</span>
Khan were prepared to permit the Russian forces
to continue their withdrawal to Russia, but were
opposed to the passage of any British troops through
their territory to Enzeli, a port on the Caspian.
General Bicherakoff refused to sever his connection
with the British, and prepared to attack the Jungalis
who were entrenched covering Manjil Bridge.  He
applied to General Dunsterville for such assistance
as he could give.
</p>

<p>
Orders were received by the Brigade on June 8th
for all cars to proceed to Kasvin, to take part in
these operations.  The cars were much in need of
overhaul after their long trip from Bagdad, and the
work of getting them ready for the road was pushed
forward as fast as possible, cars as they became
ready being sent forward.  One battery left Hamadan
on June 9th, and the whole squadron was on the
road by June 13th.
</p>

<p>
At this point the Rubberine tyres with which the
cars were fitted gave considerable trouble, and failed
to stand the wear necessitated by running over
metalled roads.  The average mileage per tyre worked
out at 60 instead of 500 miles, and spares were soon
used up.  To obtain further supplies from railhead
400 miles distant necessitated a delay of at least
ten days.  By stripping some cars it was possible
to maintain the others on the road, but by June 27th
only two cars were mobile.
</p>

<p>
As regards the failure of Rubberines, it must be
remembered that these tyres are solely intended for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P256"></a>256}</span>
work in action, and not for long-distance running.
However, pneumatic tyres had not been sent from
England, and efforts to supply the deficiency by
local purchase failed.  Some tyres were purchased,
but it was not possible to get the necessary fittings
to enable Warland rims to be efficiently converted
to take the pneumatics.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the abnormal expenditure of Rubberines
was experienced, arrangements were made to maintain
a sufficient supply, and the cars were not off
the road again on this account, although they
consumed in one month 75 per cent. of the estimated
year's supply.  Considering that a single Rubberine
tyre weighs 200 pounds, the strain imposed on the
transport of the Brigade in maintaining a sufficient
supply was considerable.
</p>

<p>
From June 13th to July 20th the cars were mainly
employed on convoy duties, and for defensive
purposes at Resht and Manjil.
</p>

<p>
On June 28th one armoured car was in action
along the Kasmar road, supporting infantry who
were attempting the rescue of an A.S.C.  officer who
had been captured by the Jungalis.  Captain
J. Macky was wounded in this engagement.
</p>

<p>
On July 20th the Jungalis made a determined
attack on Resht, which they occupied.  They, however,
failed to drive back the British troops camped
on the south-west outskirts of the town.  Both the
armoured cars of the Brigade and those of the 6th
L.A.M. Battery took a prominent part in the fighting,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P257"></a>257}</span>
and later in the relief of isolated parties cut off in
the town.  The street fighting was heavy and difficult.
Trenches were dug across the road and barricades
erected, but the armoured cars thoroughly proved
their suitability for street fighting.  Their moral
effect materially assisted in clearing the enemy out
of the town a few days later.  Captain G. N. Gawler
was wounded during the fighting.
</p>

<p>
On July 28th, to relieve the pressure at Resht,
and to make troops available to assist in the defence
of Baku, the Brigade offered to organize a motor
machine-gun company from the personnel of "B"
and "C" Squadrons then training at Hamadan,
awaiting the arrival of their cars from England.
The offer was accepted, and the company, consisting
of sixteen machine-guns (with crews), left Hamadan
on July 30th.  The machine-guns and ammunition
were carried in sixteen Ford vans, and the personnel
in the Brigade Peerless lorries.  It was decided that
half the company should remain at Resht until the
situation there improved, the other half proceeding
to Enzeli to be in readiness to embark for Baku
should the situation there permit.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
  OPERATIONS WITH GENERAL BICHERAKOFF'S FORCES<br />
  IN THE CAUCASUS.<br />
</p>

<p>
General Bicherakoff.s troops embarked at Enzeli
on July 3rd.  No. 2 Battery, "A" Squadron, was
ordered to accompany them.  In order to avoid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P258"></a>258}</span>
possible trouble with the Bolsheviks, they wore
Russian uniform, but later were ordered to discard
it.  The force landed at Aliyat, south of Baku, on
July 4th, and proceeded by rail to Kurdamir, which
was reached at midnight, July 7-8th.  The cars were
immediately detrained, and by 4 a.m. two cars were
in action on the Russian right, near Kara Sakal, and
remained in action all day against the Turkish
advanced troops.
</p>

<p>
Two reconnaissances were successfully carried out
in this area under cover of darkness, during the
night, July 8-9th, and the Turkish outposts engaged.
A reconnaissance at dawn, 3.40 a.m., on July 9th,
met with heavy machine-gun and rifle fire.
</p>

<p>
The Turks attacked the village of Kara Sakal at
5 a.m.  Their advance was greatly hampered by fire
from the cars which covered throughout the day the
withdrawal of the Russian troops in this sector to
Kurdamir.  On two occasions, the Turks having
deployed in the proximity to the road, the cars ran
right up into the opposing lines of infantry, which
they enfiladed, forcing the Turks to withdraw.
</p>

<p>
On July 10th the Russians, after a reconnaissance
by the armoured cars, attacked, but failed to reach
their objective.  An enemy counter-attack was
repulsed by the armoured cars, which eventually
covered the withdrawal of the infantry to Karrar.
A determined attack on the rearguard by enemy
cavalry was repulsed by one armoured car, with heavy
loss to the enemy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P259"></a>259}</span>
</p>

<p>
The battery withdrew to Sagiri on the llth, and
was employed continuously in reconnaissance from
July 12th to 18th.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the defection of the troops protecting
General Bicherakoff's right, he was compelled to
retire to Ballajari, which was reached without
incident on July 23rd.  The armoured cars formed a
portion of the rearguard and carried out one
reconnaissance at Kara Su, without, however, meeting any
enemy troops.
</p>

<p>
On July 26th one armoured car was ordered to
carry out a reconnaissance along Shemaka-Baku
road.  This car failed to return.  A force sent out
to look for it found two bodies, which were identified
as the driver of a Ford touring car, and a batman,
both of whom were travelling in Captain Hull's
touring car.  Unofficial reports have been received
that a British officer and four men were prisoners
at Elizabetpol.  No details as to what actually
happened are available.
</p>

<p>
On July 29th the Turks took Adji-Kabul Station,
to the south-west of Baku, and began an encircling
movement to the north.  General Bicherakoff, not
wishing to be shut up in Baku, withdrew northwards.
The armoured cars acted as rearguard, Kirdalana
being reached at 6.30 p.m.  From hereon the
armoured cars travelled by rail to Hatcmas, which
was reached on August 10th.  Although the force
was continually harassed by Tartars, the armoured
cars took no part in the fighting.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P260"></a>260}</span>
</p>

<p>
On August 11th the cars were sent forward by rail
to Kudat, to operate against the Tartars.  The
country being impassable for armoured cars, they
returned to Hatcmas.
</p>

<p>
On August 12th a general advance was made on
Derbend, but the cars still travelled by rail.  The
Bolsheviks retired from Derbend after desultory
fighting, and the town was occupied on August 15th
at 9.20 a.m.
</p>

<p>
The train on which the armoured cars were travelling
was smashed in a collision south of Derbend,
and the armoured car personnel were responsible for
the rescue of many men, under conditions calling
for gallantry and endurance.  Two N.C.O's.  received
the M.S.M.  for their gallant behaviour on this
occasion.
</p>

<p>
The armoured cars were not in action again until
the attack on Petrovsk on September 3rd.  The
armoured cars preceded the infantry at 4.30 p.m.,
and, driving in the Bolshevik troops, engaged a
battery of 6-inch guns at close range, driving the
gunners off the guns and capturing them.  They
pursued the Bolshevik troops through the town,
driving some 600 of them into the hands of the
Cossacks, who had got round to the north of the
town.
</p>

<p>
One armoured car was now immobile, owing to
back-axle trouble, and was out of action until
September 20th, when necessary spare parts were
received from Baku.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P261"></a>261}</span>
</p>

<p>
The cars remained at Petrovsk till September 10th
for overhaul, every facility and excellent
workshops being placed at their disposal by General
Bicherakoff.
</p>

<p>
On September llth the cars were sent to
Temi-Khan Shuna, thirty miles south of Petrovsk, to
co-operate in operations being carried out at that
place against a mixed force of 600 Turks and 1,500
Dageshani Tartars.  The operations fell through
owing to an armistice being arranged on the 12th.
The cars remained at Temi-Khan Shuna to maintain
order until the 19th.
</p>

<p>
On September 18th three Russian armoured cars,
which had been under the orders of the Brigade
at Baku, and had proceeded to Petrovsk when
the evacuation took place, were attached to No. 2
Battery.
</p>

<p>
On September 27th two armoured cars (one D.A.C. Brigade
and one Russian) were ordered to embark
to join Colonel Sleseneff at Briansk.  The cars were
disembarked at Starri Terechnaya by 11 a.m. on
the 30th, and left for Alexandrisk, which was reached
at 6 p.m. the same evening, moving to Marinova on
October 2nd.  Here touch was gained with General
Alexieff by aeroplane.
</p>

<p>
The advance was continued, Seri Brakovka being
reached on the 3rd.
</p>

<p>
The cars moved to Breedeekin on October 12th,
reporting to the headquarters of the force (General
Mestoulov), on the outskirts of Kislyar, at 8.30 a.m. on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P262"></a>262}</span>
the 13th.  An attack on Kislyar was ordered for
the 14th.  One armoured car was ordered to precede
the infantry attack, and clear the enemy trenches
at 12 noon, after a preliminary bombardment.  The
car was driven forward until the wheels rested on
the parapet, and the trenches were enfiladed, and
the Bolshevik infantry fled.  The car, whilst returning
to bring forward the Russian infantry, was hit
by a direct shell, which killed three of the crew and
wounded Captain Crossing and the driver.  At this
point the Russian infantry panicked, and, failing to
restore order, a general withdrawal was ordered to
Breedeekin.
</p>

<p>
The personnel of the British armoured car was
withdrawn to Petrovsk, which was reached on
September 18th.
</p>

<p>
On October 26th No. 2 Battery, which had served
with General Bicherakoff since July 3rd, was ordered
to return to Enzeli to rejoin the Brigade.
</p>

<p>
During the whole period, Captain Barratt, R.A.M.C.,
was mainly responsible for the medical work with
General Bicherakoff's force, and received the 4th
Class of the Order of St. Vladimir for his work.
</p>

<p>
Captain Crossing, D.S.C., who had commanded
this battery, received the St. George's Cross for
gallantry, and also the 4th Class of the Order of
St. Vladimir.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant E. W. Wallace also received the 4th
Class of the Order of St  Vladimir, and several
St. George's Crosses were awarded to the men.

<p class="t3b">
OPERATIONS AT BAKU.
</p>

<p>
At the end of July the new Government in Baku
asked for British assistance.  One section of No. 1
Battery (two cars) and two sections of the motor
machine-gun company embarked at Enzeli, arriving
at Baku August 5th.  The remaining section of No. 1
Battery and two sections of the machine-gun
company were withdrawn from Resht on August 6th,
embarking the same evening for Baku, which was
reached on August 7th.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the presence of Bolshevik troops in the
town, the armoured cars and machine-gun company
did not proceed to the line.  There were constant
threats that the Bolsheviks intended to attempt to
turn out the new Government by a <i>coup de main</i>.
The armoured cars "stood to" every night, whilst
machine-guns were located in various buildings
commanding the streets leading to the quarter of the
town in which the British troops were billeted.
</p>

<p>
In order to stiffen and encourage the local forces,
British troops were sent into the line on August 9th.
One section of the motor machine-gun company took
up positions at Voltchi Vorota on the left of the line,
co-operating with detachments of the Staffords.
Efforts were also made to organize the Russian
machine-guns in this section of the line, with some
success.  (The organization of the Russian machine-guns
was later handed over to Major Vandenberg.)
</p>

<p>
On the same date two armoured cars and one and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P264"></a>264}</span>
a half sections of the motor machine-gun company
were sent to Zabrat, to take part in operations being
carried out against Mashtagi.  These two cars were
constantly in action, handling very severely about
100 Turks who were found sitting and lying about
behind a hedge.
</p>

<p>
The machine-guns took up positions in the Armenian
lines.  These machine-guns were taken forward, and
then covered the advance of the Armenians.  No
serious attack on Mashtagi was, however, at any
time made by the local forces.
</p>

<p>
One incident in this area is worth recording.  At
the request of Headquarters a Brigade Vauxhall
Staff car was lent for the purpose of taking Tartar
delegates to the front line, from whence it was
intended that the delegates should make their way
behind the Turkish lines and arrange terms with the
local Tartars.  Through some error, the car, also
containing in addition to the delegates two sergeants
of the Brigade, was sent on through the lines and
captured by the Turks.  Sergeant Miks was captured
on this occasion.  Russian born, he was a local
linguist, and had gone through some remarkable
adventures, whilst keeping under observation the
movements of the Bolsheviks in Baku.
</p>

<p>
On August 14th one section of guns took up a
position in the line at the foot of Griazni Vulkan,
to the north-east of Baladjari Station.  The next
few days were fully occupied in the construction of
machine-gun emplacements.  Two armoured cars
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P265"></a>265}</span>
and a half-section of the motor machine-gun
company were retained in Baku in reserve to maintain
order in the town.  On August 24th one of these
armoured cars proceeded to Griazni Vulkan, where
it remained in support of the line.
</p>

<p>
On August 26th the Turkish attack, the imminence
of which was evident from the daily reconnaissance
reports, materialized against Griazni Vulkan.  The
advance took place under cover of heavy and
destructive artillery fire, which caused considerable
casualties.  The line at the point of the attack was
held by 150 Staffords and four machine-guns of the
Brigade motor machine-gun company.  The attack
was three times brought to a halt, the machine-guns
doing great execution.  One gun's crew withdrew
their gun from its emplacement, which had overhead
cover, and remounted it on top in order to obtain
a greater field of fire.  Enemy reinforcements coming
up about 2 p.m. caused the troops on the right flank
to fall back.  The two machine-guns in this area,
however, remained at their posts, and were last seen
still firing, although completely surrounded.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of the infantry were forced to
withdraw, but this order did not reach the remaining
two guns, which only left their positions when they
found small parties of enemy in rear of them.  Fifty
per cent. of the crews became casualties whilst
withdrawing.  Lieutenant Titterington, who was in
charge, was compelled to use his revolver.
</p>

<p>
The armoured car in this sector, which, owing to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P266"></a>266}</span>
the impossible nature of the ground, had not
previously been able to come into action, now covered
the withdrawal of the remnants.  These were
reorganized by Major Ruston, a new line formed, and
a further withdrawal carried out in good order to a
line some 2,000 yards to the east.  Fresh gun crews
were immediately organized from batmen and other
employed men of the Brigade, and sent forward to
man the two guns that were left.
</p>

<p>
On August 27th the section of the machine-gun
company was withdrawn from Voltchi Vorota, and
received orders to report to the O.C. 39th Brigade,
who took over charge of the Baladjari Sector on the
evening of August 26th.  The new line ran from
Baladjari to Vinagradi.  Two guns were placed in
position at Baladjari and two on Vinagradi Hill.
</p>

<p>
The Turks had suffered so heavily on the 26th that
they waited till the 31st before resuming their attack.
During the interval reorganization was carried out,
and, owing to heavy casualties, crews were only
available for two sections of machine-guns and three
armoured cars.  One armoured car was immobile
owing to magneto trouble, and did not come again
into action whilst at Baku.  The Turks attacked
Vinagradi Hill on August 31st, and, as the flanks of
the infantry were too exposed to permit of sustained
resistance, they withdrew shortly after the attack
developed.  Orders again did not reach the two
machine-guns in this sector, who maintained their
position single-handed for an hour and a half,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P267"></a>267}</span>
inflicting considerable casualties before they were
forced to withdraw, owing to enemy fire, from the
rear.  They took up a fresh position on the
railway-line east of Baladjari.
</p>

<p>
During the whole of the period of fighting two
armoured cars and six machine-guns (reduced to four
after August 26th) remained inactive in the Mashtagi
area.
</p>

<p>
The capture of Dighiya on September 1st endangered
the security of the force in front of Mashtagi,
which accordingly withdrew.  The armoured cars
and machine-guns took up a position about 1,000
yards south of Balakhani.
</p>

<p>
The Turkish success made the evacuation of Baku
advisable, and orders were issued for evacuation to
take place in the evening.  These were later cancelled
owing to the attitude of the local authorities
and Caspian Fleet, and orders issued for a last stand
to be made on the inner defensive line.
</p>

<p>
The next few days were spent in building the
necessary defences.
</p>

<p>
On September 1st the Russian armoured car
section, consisting of two heavy cars mounting
3-pounders, and two light cars with maxims, under
the command of Lieutenant-Colonel the Marquis
Albrizzi, were placed under the orders of the Brigade.
They were mainly employed supporting attacks
against Tartar villages on the right flank, which
never materialized.
</p>

<p>
Between September 1st and 13th a general
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P268"></a>268}</span>
concentration of the Turks was noticed south-west of
Baladjari.  On the evening of the 12th an Arab
officer deserter gave full details of the expected
Turkish attack, which was to take place during the
early hours of the morning on the 14th against the
Voltchi Vorota Sector, a feint being made to hold
the troops at Baladjari.  The attack developed as
stated at 6 a.m. on the 14th.  The feint attack in
front of Baladjari was heavily handled by our machine-guns
and rapidly brought to a standstill.  The main
attack, however, against the local troops, progressed
satisfactorily.
</p>

<p>
The two armoured cars from Baladjari were
withdrawn to the Seliansky Barracks at the north-west
corner of the town at 9 a.m.  Their departure opened
up the left flank of the position at Baladjari.  This,
together with the danger of being cut off by the
main attack, forced the Baladjari detachment to
withdraw at 1.30 p.m.  They were covered by the
machine-guns, which retired successfully, the last
gun only leaving when the Turks were within 100 yards
of their position, three members of the crew being
wounded during the withdrawal.  They took up a
fresh position on the top of a ridge some 600 yards
to the rear.
</p>

<p>
At 8 a.m. one armoured car was ordered out along
the Voltchi Vorota road.  It here engaged the
enemy single-handed for two and a half hours, and
though shelled intensively, managed to escape
destruction by continuously moving in a figure of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P269"></a>269}</span>
eight in the very small space available for manoeuvre.
This checking of the main attack allowed the Russian
forces to be re-formed in rear and stiffened up with
British troops.  The remaining two armoured cars
from Baladjari were ordered into action along the
Baladjari road, with orders to prevent the troops
withdrawing from Baladjari from being cut off.
They were in action in this area the whole day,
running up among the Turkish troops and inflicting
very heavy casualties, destroying three enemy
machine-guns and dispersing in panic some Turkish
cavalry which were massing for the attack.
</p>

<p>
At 11 a.m. the machine-gun section from the
Balakhani road was withdrawn, and remained in
reserve throughout the afternoon near Seliansky
Barracks.
</p>

<p>
At 5 p.m. orders for the evacuation of Baku were
received, the armoured cars being disposed as follows,
to cover the withdrawal of the infantry:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  1 car on the Dighiyar road.<br />
  1 &nbsp; " &nbsp; " &nbsp; " &nbsp; Baladjari road.<br />
  1 &nbsp; " &nbsp; " &nbsp; " &nbsp; Voltchi Vorota road.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The withdrawal commenced at 8 p.m. and was
carried out without incident, the last car arriving
at the embarkation point at 10 p.m.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the still doubtful attitude of the local
authorities and Caspian Fleet, it was considered
inadvisable to delay whilst the armoured cars were
embarked, and orders were issued for their destruction,
as well as for the destruction of the motor
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P270"></a>270}</span>
transport which had accompanied the Brigade, and
which had done most useful work in rationing the
Brigade and other British troops in the line.  The
following cars were consequently destroyed:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  4 Austin armoureds.<br />
  6 Vauxhall tenders.<br />
  3 Ford touring cars.<br />
  2 Ford ambulances.<br />
  18 Ford vans.<br />
  1 Ford van (belonging to Wireless Section).<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Kazian was reached on September 16th.
</p>

<p>
During the fighting leading to the evacuation the
Russians' cars under the Marquis Albrizzi rendered
valuable assistance, and covered the withdrawal of
the local troops in the early morning of the 15th,
and were eventually evacuated with General
Bicherakoff's detachment to Petrovsk, where they were
attached to No. 2 Battery of the Brigade.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
OPERATIONS AT ZINJAN.
</p>

<p>
During the fighting at Baku a considerable
concentration of troops at Tabriz enabled the Turks to
advance towards Zinjan, driving our outposts at
Mianeh across the Kufian Kuh.
</p>

<p>
Eight more armoured cars from England arrived
at Hamadan on September 1st.  In spite of the fact
that the majority of the personnel for these cars had
been taken to form the machine-gun company, the
balance of personnel was rapidly organized and
"E" Squadron formed.  The cars needed considerable
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P271"></a>271}</span>
attention mechanically, and this was rapidly
carried out, cars as they were fit for the road being
despatched to Zinjan.
</p>

<p>
The serious threat to the main communications to
Enzeli by this Turkish advance necessitated the
consideration of a general withdrawal to Hamadan
on September llth.  In spite of mechanical difficulties,
the Brigade offered to get the whole squadron
to Zinjan immediately, and, further, to organize from
batmen and cooks sufficient crews to man four
machine-guns, the whole being carried in a Peerless
lorry.  This squadron and machine-gun section were
concentrated at Zinjan by September 16th, and their
addition to the small force justified a stand being
made north of that place, and the orders for the
evacuation being held in abeyance.  Reconnaissances,
in which one section 6th L.A.M. Battery played a
considerable part, were pushed out as far as
Jamalabad, where Turkish cavalry were engaged.
</p>

<p>
"E" Squadron had considerable trouble from
back axles giving.  The presence of armoured cars
undoubtedly checked the advance of the Turkish
troops beyond Jamalabad.
</p>

<p>
An additional twelve armoured cars left Bagdad on
August 19th, arriving at Hamadan on September 1st.
These cars also needed overhauling, and in view of
the back-axle trouble experienced by "E" Squadron
it was considered desirable to take down all back
axles and thoroughly overhaul them.  In the
meantime the personnel of "D" Squadron was collected,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P272"></a>272}</span>
organized, and trained.  This squadron was stationed
at Hamadan, for fear of any possible advance of
Turkish troops from Urumia via Bijar.
</p>

<p>
A road reconnaissance towards Bijar was carried
out by two armoured cars on October 3rd.  These
reported that the road was impassable, and the
country unsuitable for armoured cars some sixty
miles north of Hamadan.
</p>

<p>
On the formation of Norperforce on September 14th,
it was pointed out that Persia did not offer
opportunity for the employment of a large number of
armoured cars, whilst there was great difficulty in
obtaining the requisite petrol to keep the Brigade
mobile.  It was considered that the armoured-car
work could be carried out by eight cars, especially
as the approach of winter would make movement
impossible.  Much of the work would be in the
nature of patrol work, and previous experience had
shown that this was very expensive in Rubberine
tyres.  The pneumatic tyres for the cars had not
up till that date arrived from England.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, on October 2nd the withdrawal to
Mesopotamia commenced.
</p>

<p>
There are one or two features of interest as regards
the rationing worthy of record.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the heat and the rapidity with which
fresh meat went bad, considerable difficulty was
experienced in rationing convoys, which might be
absent several days from main rationing bases.  No
tinned meat was available, and after several experiments
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P273"></a>273}</span>
a successful method of dry-salting and sun-drying
mutton was found.  Meat thus treated proved
very palatable when soaked and cooked, and kept
even in the hottest weather for several weeks.
</p>

<p>
Jam was made from fruit purchased locally, and
stored in earthenware jars, a jam ration being issued
to the men the whole time they were in Persia.
Crushed wheat proved excellent for porridge.
</p>

<p>
This excellent result was mainly due to the initiative
and hard work of the Brigade Quartermaster, Captain
Lefroy and his staff.
</p>

<p>
To sum up, the Brigade, in addition to entirely
supporting its own personnel in rations, munitions,
and stores of all kinds, afforded very considerable
assistance in transport to Dunsterforce.  It
maintained all armoured cars which had arrived from
England, working over 1,000 miles from railhead,
and had all available personnel in the fighting-line
as a machine-gun company at Baku, some 800 miles
from railhead.  The whole time it was solely
dependent on its own efforts.
</p>

<p>
The work was entirely due to the magnificent body
of officers and men forming the unit, who have worked
throughout unsparingly in whatever duty they have
been called upon to perform.  The gallantry shown
by the men of the machine-gun company in the fight
of August 26th, when they stayed with their guns
to the last, is enhanced by the fact that practically
all these men had under eight months' service in the
Army.

Produced by Al Haines
Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
